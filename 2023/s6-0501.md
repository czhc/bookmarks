# Sprint 6 - 05/01

## Consensys / ETHKL

- [Linnea](https://consensys.net/zkevm/) - consensys public zkevm testnet
- Trilemma - decentralization v security v scalability. 
- Other names: polygon, kakarot, scroll, 
- [Availability](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/wtf-is-data-availability-80c2c95ded0f): guarantee that block porposers are required to public to guarantee all nodes in the network have access to data in the chain
- L2: execution, L1: settlement, consensus and data availability

- Rollup: 
	+ on-chaint contract: blocks, state updates, user deposits
	+ off-chain VM: computation and state storage on another VM separate from EVM
	+ operators / validators/ aggregators/ sequencers: aggreagate txn, compress data, publish block on ethereum. 
		* Seuqencers: more control over ordering, only entity allowed to submit txn on on-chain contract. some rollups only have 1 sequencer or semi-centralized sequencers e.g. polygon, arbitrum, optimism
	
- ZK rollups (vs optimistic): requires validatiy proof before being published instead of posting all txn data on-chain
	+ prove the corectness of a statement w/o revealing the statement 
	+ recursive zk proofs for limitless scale
	
- Types of zkevm: [vb](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)
	+ tyep 1: full etherun equent
	+ twype 2: full EVM equi
	+ type 3: partial EVM equivalent
	+ type 4: high-level language equivalent
	+ The more equivalent to ethereum or EVM, the more readily compatible (opcode, bytecode), but longer prover times.
	
- Existing contracts can deploy directly on linea. Linea is type 3 moving to type 2. 

- Choosing a rollup: 
	+ finality
	+ liquidity
	+ EVM compatibility/equivalence
	+ users (size)
	+ security
	+ future proof
	
- linea vs scroll:
	+ llinea: recursive SNARKs, parallel processing, modular architecture
		* no chllanger period as a zkevm, low gas fees, low latecncy, high throughput
	+ scroll: focus on privacy, advanced cryptographic Bulletproofs, modular architecture
- linear: 
	+ multi-prover sequencers / multi-proofs per batch (scroll + linear + polycon)  --> verifier (ethereum)

- 5 principals for consensual web: 
	+ user-owned accounts
	+ accessible interface
	+ explicit requests
	+ revocable permissions
	+ share progressively - mindfully choose what to share

- [Metamask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/)
	- Dapp API
	- mobile SDK
	- SDK: extensions
* https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/discussions/675 
- A snap is a JavaScript program run in an isolated environment that customizes the wallet experience. Snaps have access to a limited set of capabilities, determined by the permissions the user granted them during installation.
- A snap can have its own API
- A snap: 
	+ source code (JS, TS, WASM)
	+ manifest file snap.manifest.json
	+ package.json
- publish snap to npmjs.io
- use-cases: 
	+ Display a custom confirmation screen in MetaMask.
	* Notify users in MetaMask.
	* Securely store and manage data on your device using ipfs snap
	* Control non-EVM accounts and assets in MetaMask.
	* Provide transaction insights in MetaMask's pre-transaction window.
	* Schedule periodic actions for your users.
	* Display custom UI in MetaMask using a set of pre-defined components, including inline Markdown.
+ There is still no marketplace of snaps
- what to do with snaps: 
	+ chains, state channels
	+ evm extnesions, 
	+ communication e.g. push notification
	+ identity
	+ privacy, 
	+ L2s
	+ account abstraction
