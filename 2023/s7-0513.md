## 1. Optimistic Rollups
off-chain processing for high tps, BUT on-chain dispute resolution
Started from state/payment channels, then plasma, then optimistic

- collection of contracts, stores off-chain data e.g. state root, txn data in calldata
- activities in call data: not reexceted in L1, and is not bound to L1
- can re-exec txn if state root if correct

- use off-chain components (code) for computation and stores full off-chain state data
