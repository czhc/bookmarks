## Smart Contracts

- [x] [Smart Contract Design Patterns](https://medium.com/@i6mi6/solidty-smart-contracts-design-patterns-ecfa3b1e9784)
- [x] [ERC standards](https://101blockchains.com/erc-standards/) (2018):
    * ERC-20: Fungible token standard
    * [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): Non-fungible token standard. Transfer and track NFTs
        * examples: physical property, virtual collectables, and _negative value_ assets: loans etc.
        * no two houses are alike. ownership of each NFT must be tracked separately
        * wallet/broker app MUST implement wallet interface `ERC721TokenReceiver` for safe transfers.
        * NFT **identifiers** are uinque `uin256` and is not changed for entire life of the contract/NFT. `(address, tokenID)` pair must be globally unique and full-qualified.
        * callers shall not assume that ID numbers have a pattern to them.
        * transfer implmentations can pause trnasfers, blacklist receiving address , disallow unsafe trnasfers, charge fees two ways and readonly NFT registries.
    * [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165): Method standard. Publishing/Detecting interfaces that a smart contract uses.
        * every ERC721 must implement ERC165.
        * _interfaces_ defined broadly as all functions in an ABI - a subset of the Solidity `interface`
        * checking if implementing contract fp mathes fp of given interface with `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)`
        * i.e. if a contract implements ERC165, it will have a `supportsInterface` function that lets you query it if it has a given interface, and what version of interface.
    * ERC-223: allows contract to decline tokens. prevents accidental burning of non-supported tokens - still open
    * ~~ERC-621: introduce modifying token supply using `increaseSupply` and `decreaseSupply`~~ closed
    * [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777):  identify receipt of token, allows receiver to reject tokens from a blacklist address or decline payment.
        * improvement on ERC20 for _fungible_ tokens
        * requires [ERC-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) as a universal contract registry (which contract, which interface) - compatible with ERC-165
        * _operators_ (special, trusted contracts) send tokens on behalf of contracts, and react with _hooks_  for token holders to control sending/receipt.
        * contracts/addresses register sendable/receiveable tokens.
        * removes decimals - all amounts and balances is stored as denomination of E-18, decimal places fixed at 18.
        * Minting and Burning events
        * [OpenZep](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc777)
    * ERC-827: extension on ee3. Token holders can transfer or approve 3rd party spending. - draft
    * ERC-884:  Tokenized stocks including KYC of holders, recording regulator mandate, record transfer of shares with off-chain database - draft.
    * ERC-865: Pay transfers in token itself, instead of separate currency of gas (ETH).
    * ERC 1155: fungible + non-fungible
        * multiple token types in a single contract
        * semi-fungibles and transmutation between the two.
        * batch transfers in a single txn.
        * 1155 tokens cannot be accidentally locked in unsupported contracts
        * triggers with events `onERC1155Received`
        * stores metadata in URI - no need to store in token itself. infinite token URIs, no need to store this data on-chain.
        * rich events for mint, burn, transfer, approval and metadata changes.

- [x] [Consensys](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)
: Stop using Solidity's `transfer()`
   * EIP1884 increases gas cost of `SLOAD` and breaks existing contracts. ETH transfers via `transfer()` and `send()` consumes 2300 gas, and this increase in SLOAD cost will exceed gas limits.
   * EIP1884 motivation: rebalance opcode cost for resource consumption, making sload more expensive and resistant to underpriced-DOS attacks.
   * **Solution:** use `call()` + CEI or `ReentrancyGuard`
   * CEI pattern is intentionally optimistic. All validations should be done in `Check`, Assume and apply changes in `Effect`. Leaving no more operation to be executed after `Interactions` except for `revert`
   > Optimistically deal with state changes (accounting) - assume success.
   > Interact with the contract.
   > Revert changes from step 1 if needed (.transfer()) does it automatically. revert() is an option, or manually return all values to their previous values in the unlikely event that you want to continue.
   - [x] [OZ.ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)
      * inherit `nonReentrant` modifier, apply to functions to prevent nested/reentrant self/direct/indirect calls. functions with `nonReentrant` may not call one another, unless they are made `private` + `external`,

- [x] [Solidity Inheritance](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/solidity-inheritance) & Constructors
   * inheriting contracts can access all non-`private` state variables and internal functions. But not accessible with `this`.
   * abstract/inherited contracts can be used as an interface for functions (without defnitions)
   * overloading: replacing functions with another with **same name AND same number of inputs** - otherwise, throws error.

## NFTs

ERC 1155 seems to be mostly implemented by Enjin projects, since it was founded by Enjin.

- [x] Enjin launches [JumpNet](https://enjin.io/software/jumpnet): NFTs with no gas fees.
    * free gas powered by [Efinity / $EFI](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/efinity-parachain) Parachain on polkadot.
    - [x] [Efinity whitepaper](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/introduction)
        * _Efinityâ€™s purpose is to be an NFT highway, not a general computing blockchain._
        * Paratoken standard accepts tokens from any other chains including ERC721,1155,20 - interoperable with entire polkadot eco.
        * grouped NFTs - NFTs part of a family with same based ID.
        * Efniity to scale to 700-1000 tps, confirmation in 6 seconds.
    * Note: Enjin Jumpnet lets you choose **zero-fee txns for your ERC1155**. Fees are paid in JENJ tokens if charged.
        * aisde from that, standard minting functionality: supply distribution, burn controls etc.
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to move Enjin Coin (ENJ) between Ethereum and JumpNet
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to send and receive ENJ and ERC-1155 tokens for free
        > Use the Enjin Platform to mint ERC-1155 tokens, no gas required
        > Use the Enjin Marketplace to trade ERC-1155 tokens without gas fees
        > Use our API to automatically distribute ERC-1155 tokens from your app or game
        > Use Enjin Beam to distribute ERC-1155 tokens via QR codes for free*

- [ ] IPFS [whitepaper](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf)
   * how is the CID generated? why is it unique regardless of filename? 

- [x] Best Practices for [Storing NFT Data using IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/best-practices-for-nft-data/#types-of-ipfs-links-and-when-to-use-them)
   * Types of IPFS links: 
      * **1. CIDs** e.g. `bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`. Has versions `0` or `1`: different encoding. Version 0 starts with `Qm`.
         * use `ipfs add --cid-version=1 /PATH_TO_FILE/`
         * Convert v0 and v1 CIDs using [`cid.ipfs.io`](https://cid.ipfs.io/#QmS6efuWDcczDcaAexbf6aTQ9i9d9sukF1VNcZuB5efp4b)
      * **2. IPFS URI**: with uri scheme `ipfs://`
      * **3. HTTP gateway URLs e.g. `dweb.link`
   * CIDs are always unique and generated from the _content_. 
      * **if `image.png` and `image-copy.png` are duplicates, they always result in the same CID**. 
   * [Pinning files](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/): tell IPFS to always keep an object. IPFS objects are cached, but may be garbage-collected regularly.
      * Direct pinnin: ping just a single block
      * Recursive pins: ping a block and its children
      * Indirect pins: result of a block's parent being pinned recursively
   * NFT metadata - some structured data file e.g. JSON. There is a standard for metadata schemas that should include `"title"`, `"type"`, `"properties": {}` as defined in [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) and [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) to be readily read by other apps.
   * to link to images: simply **use IPFS URI (2)**. since it is not tied to a specific gateway provider. The application presentation layer can layer transform this to HTTP.
      * also because IPFS URIs are permanent
   * Preserve IPFS human readables by wrapping them in directories. 
      *  with `ipfs` command line: use `-w` flag: returns 2 hashes. First hash is for the content, second hash is for directory.
      *  to read a directory, use `-v` flag e.g. `ipfs ls -v <directory uid>`
   * i.e. to update an image and its metadata
      * prepare metadata file: `metadata.json` with standard schema: [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
      * use ipfs to upload both files: `ipfs add --cid-version=1  -w  assets/my-image.png assets/metadata.json`
      * pin: `ipfs pin add <MY-DIRECTORY-CID>`
      * browse: `ipfs://<MY-DIRECTORY-CID>`, has both `ipfs://<MY-Duse pinning services to IR-CID>/my-image.png` and `ipfs://<MY-DIR-CID>/metadata.json`
   * Data in IPFS is only persistent as long as a peer _keeps_ it in local storage. For persistence, use a 3rd party pinning service to constantly store your files e.g. [Pinata](pinata.cloud) and [Eternum](https://www.eternum.io/). There's no need to migrate since CIDs are permanent.

   * asset file and metadata.json file are uploaded separately. 
   * NFT (ERC721) contract references a `uri` that is pointing to the `metadata.json`. The metadata file then points to the asset file in its `image` key
   * same process in ethereum or polygon, just switch network configurations. 
   * after deploying and updating uri, check [NFT contract](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0xd5dc2cbfde4c0b587870ec7aa040c9551228be23#readContract) on polygonscan -> call `tokenURI()` -> get `ipfs://QmQ3ayz3G45ztZR3L2s2Vjfcy9CmYr1kKpQmhhkXWYafDs` -> get `"image"` attribute -> get asset file / folder

- [x] [8.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMnBl0g3Ev4) Public Policy
   * Global approach to crypto finance: 
   * 1. guarding against illicit activities
      * tax compliance & reporting: is it currency or property?
      * Bank Secrecy Act: KYC & AML. CTF (Counter Terrorism finance).
      * challenges: pseudonymous addresses, privacy coins/tumbling/mixing, compliance and reporting. + crypto-to-crypto transactions. 
      * dark markets on TOR e.g. Silk Road. 
   * 2. financial stability:
      * capital control (restricting tradable pairs to central currency) to maintain stability. crypto allows indirect conversation of RMB -> electricity -> BTC -> USD. 
   * 3. protecting the investing public:
      * full & fair disclosure from issuers
      * fraud & deceptives sales practices
      * secondary markets w/ price transparency and anti-manipulation
      * advisor conflict of interest disclosure

      * 1. investment of money or assets?
      * 2. is the investment a common enterprise - is a group of devs with open source a common enterprise?

      * Does not have POW/51% protection.
   * Permissionless
      * Unknown participants
      * Security based on incentives from staking, mining etc. 
      * Has native currrency
      * Governed by crypto economics
   * Blockchains vs Traditional databases - **do you need a blockchain?**
      * Public blockchain: public write capability, p2p txns, removing central intermediary to remove economic rents, token economics
      * Private blockchains: private writes only, finality in append-only log, public verifiability (more than write parties), 
      * Trad database: Trusted party hosts data and CRUD. Client-server architecture.

# L2, Sidechains, Scaling

- [x] [Avail](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-avail-by-polygon-a-robust-general-purpose-scalable-data-availability-layer-98bc9814c048) by Polygon 
   * _general-purpose, scalable data availability-focused blockchain_ shared by sidechains & off-chain scaling: e.g. Polygon SDK + Cosmos SDK + Substrate SDK
   * **sidechains/standalones can bootstrap _validator security_ with guarantee txn data availability provided by Avail. **
   * **Data Availability problem**: liteclients do not download entire blocks - can be tricked into accepting blocks whose underlying data is not available.
   * Solutions: (1) ensuraing availability of txn data, (2) esure txn ordering -  block is valid only if data is available. prevents block producers from releasing block headers without the data behind them.
   * Availability checks: light client sample small, random cunks from each block. Non-consensus nodes provider for greater secure block sizes
   * **[KZG commmitment](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html)** 
      * Data redundancy: prevents product from hiding blocks
      * Fraud proof free guarantee of correct erasure coding
      * Vector commitments allow full nodes to convince txn inclusion 
   * Application needs app-specific standalone chain - spins up new PoS using polygon/cosmos/substrate -- still needs to gain security through validator staking.
   * instead use Avail for txn ordering and dtata availability. 
   * Submit txn to polygon SDK chain -> Availa -> order is matnained in Avail. Assurance: ordered data is available and standalon chain can reconstruct app state. 
   * Other L2 solutions **move execution off-chain** while **ensuring verification and availabilty on-chain**: still limited by tps of Ethereum. 
      * Optmistic: operator may submit invalid txn. will nt be able to produce fraud-proofs due to lack of data
      * ZKIP: esnures accepted txns are valid. but zero-knowledge (not revealing data backing a txn) may lead to other validators not being able to calculate state
   * Components:
      *  data hosting and ordering: order txns without execution, store and ensure complete availability
      *  execution: execute ordered txns from Avail with checkpoint-assert-proof (CAP)
      *  verfication/dispute: process CAP, guarantees only valid state txns are accepted.

### Optimism

- [ ] [Paradigm: How does Optimism's Rollup really work?](https://research.paradigm.xyz/optimism)
   * Reusing existing stack of Ethereum (smart contracts on Solidiy/Vyper, EVM and Go-ethereum client implementation) - little/no modifications for UX and security by not reinventing the wheel. 
   * EVM opcodes would not behave the same on L1 and L2 
   * OVM: sandboxed env guarantes deterministic smart contract execn between L1 <> L2
      * L2 calls `TIMESTAMP`
      * 1 hour later, txn is replayed on L1
      * in OVM, `ovmTIMESTAMP` (from L2) should match `TIMESTAMP` in L1. 
      * all context-dependent EVM options is `ovm{OPCODE}`.
      * some opcodes are removed by Optimism `SafetyChecker` to make contract OVM-safe
   * Optimistic Solidity: Making smart contracts executable in OVM
      * (1) new smart contract language - too complex
      * (2) transpile EVM bytecode to OVM - abandoned
      * (3) support solidiy/vyper by modifying compilers to OVM: each opcode compiles to EVM assembly, rewritten to OVM variant. 
      * [EVM disassembler](https://github.com/daejunpark/evm-disassembler)
      * to workaround unsupported opscodes (`SLOAD`): bytecode makes `CALL` > `CALLER` push receiver to stack > `ovmSLOAD` handles and adds data to memory
      * OVM contracts must still remain in 24KB, same as EVM limits to be executable.
   * Optimistic Geth: making txn processing OVM compatible
      *  Mod 1: Replace `to` in messages to Sequencer Entrypoint address.
      *  Mod 2: Replace `to to Exceution Manager address. Txns sent to OVM sandbox Execution Manager
      *  Mod 3: messages targeting State Manager are intercepted and rerouted to Geth's StateDB / do nothing because Optimistic Geth does not use StateManager. 
      *  Mod 4: Txn batching using Epoch/time-segments, not blocks because OVM does not have block. Each txn executino checks if a new epoc needs to be started.
      *  Mod 5: Rollup sync service monitors logs, processing and injecting L2 txns.

   * Will reduce 7-day lockup to near instantaneous for DAI only to make Maker primary off-ramp. 
   * Optimism in general requires 7 day lockup. By
   * _Maker protocol can take advantage of this by offering a token (fDAI) which represents a claim on the L1 DAI through a vault which allows locking up fDAI in exchange for newly minted regular DAI. fDAI is then validated by a Maker Oracle which can verify against the CTC._

   * _Due to the permissionless nature of Optimism, we will need to move fast to secure the initial Dai bridge._



## Security

   - [ ] [What is Reentrancy](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/)
   * Normal contract execution can call other contract functions. This also means they can call back /re-enter the original contract. 
   * This is a problem if the state is inconsistent i.e. why you should make all local state changes before calling another contract.
   * invariant - properties of the state that are expected to always be true

## How to Defi

   * yearn v. stakedao v. convex 
   * yearn yveCRV+yveCRV-ETH v. stakedao sdve-CRV -> Convex cvxCRV
   * for a protocol to use veCRV, requires whitelist (acquire 30% of supply to be whitelisted) 
   * alchemix prevented from using alETH in curve
   * Curve alternatives: Swerve (defunct), Saddle, Uniswapv3 stable swap (took 40% volume) 
- [X] Hasu on [Governance Tokens](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/why-i-have-changed-my-mind-on-tokens/)
   * Against tokens:
      * governance is an attack vector
      * crypto should replace rent-seeking institutions with open and fair protocols
      * open source protocols can be forked and lead to equilibrium rent of zero  
   * Govt tokens that should accrue fees (rent) do so because they require human input: BTC, MKR, COMP. UNI and SUSHI doesn't need similar incentives because their participation reward/risk is in isolated pools. 
   * Instead of minimizing rent, optimizing it for incentivizing human capital, competition, open source etc. 
   * on forks: forking is easy but without collecting rent (fees), there is no incentive for adoption. 
   * Gov tokens and preminig enables capital raising and hiring talent
   * Netowrk effects (_increased value from increased participants_) are not forkable - no brand, no liquidity, no commmunity. Getting to a certain size makes a protocol resistant to forks. Tokens with rents is used to bootstrap to get there.

#### Liquidity Sniping

When new LP is created on DEX, buy new tokens and sell to new buyers. ut in same block or new several blocks as creation/funding on LP.
