## Smart Contracts

- [x] [Smart Contract Design Patterns](https://medium.com/@i6mi6/solidty-smart-contracts-design-patterns-ecfa3b1e9784)
- [x] [ERC standards](https://101blockchains.com/erc-standards/) (2018):
    * ERC-20: Fungible token standard
    * [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): Non-fungible token standard. Transfer and track NFTs
        * examples: physical property, virtual collectables, and _negative value_ assets: loans etc.
        * no two houses are alike. ownership of each NFT must be tracked separately
        * wallet/broker app MUST implement wallet interface `ERC721TokenReceiver` for safe transfers.
        * NFT **identifiers** are uinque `uin256` and is not changed for entire life of the contract/NFT. `(address, tokenID)` pair must be globally unique and full-qualified.
        * callers shall not assume that ID numbers have a pattern to them.
        * transfer implmentations can pause trnasfers, blacklist receiving address , disallow unsafe trnasfers, charge fees two ways and readonly NFT registries.
    * [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165): Method standard. Publishing/Detecting interfaces that a smart contract uses.
        * every ERC721 must implement ERC165.
        * _interfaces_ defined broadly as all functions in an ABI - a subset of the Solidity `interface`
        * checking if implementing contract fp mathes fp of given interface with `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)`
        * i.e. if a contract implements ERC165, it will have a `supportsInterface` function that lets you query it if it has a given interface, and what version of interface.
    * ERC-223: allows contract to decline tokens. prevents accidental burning of non-supported tokens - still open
    * ~~ERC-621: introduce modifying token supply using `increaseSupply` and `decreaseSupply`~~ closed
    * [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777):  identify receipt of token, allows receiver to reject tokens from a blacklist address or decline payment.
        * improvement on ERC20 for _fungible_ tokens
        * requires [ERC-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) as a universal contract registry (which contract, which interface) - compatible with ERC-165
        * _operators_ (special, trusted contracts) send tokens on behalf of contracts, and react with _hooks_  for token holders to control sending/receipt.
        * contracts/addresses register sendable/receiveable tokens.
        * removes decimals - all amounts and balances is stored as denomination of E-18, decimal places fixed at 18.
        * Minting and Burning events
        * [OpenZep](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc777)
    * ERC-827: extension on ee3. Token holders can transfer or approve 3rd party spending. - draft
    * ERC-884:  Tokenized stocks including KYC of holders, recording regulator mandate, record transfer of shares with off-chain database - draft.
    * ERC-865: Pay transfers in token itself, instead of separate currency of gas (ETH).
    * ERC 1155: fungible + non-fungible
        * multiple token types in a single contract
        * semi-fungibles and transmutation between the two.
        * batch transfers in a single txn.
        * 1155 tokens cannot be accidentally locked in unsupported contracts
        * triggers with events `onERC1155Received`
        * stores metadata in URI - no need to store in token itself. infinite token URIs, no need to store this data on-chain.
        * rich events for mint, burn, transfer, approval and metadata changes.

## NFTs

ERC 1155 seems to be mostly implemented by Enjin projects, since it was founded by Enjin.

- [x] Enjin launches [JumpNet](https://enjin.io/software/jumpnet): NFTs with no gas fees.
    * free gas powered by [Efinity / $EFI](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/efinity-parachain) Parachain on polkadot.
    - [x] [Efinity whitepaper](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/introduction)
        * _Efinityâ€™s purpose is to be an NFT highway, not a general computing blockchain._
        * Paratoken standard accepts tokens from any other chains including ERC721,1155,20 - interoperable with entire polkadot eco.
        * grouped NFTs - NFTs part of a family with same based ID.
        * Efniity to scale to 700-1000 tps, confirmation in 6 seconds.
    * Note: Enjin Jumpnet lets you choose **zero-fee txns for your ERC1155**. Fees are paid in JENJ tokens if charged.
        * aisde from that, standard minting functionality: supply distribution, burn controls etc.
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to move Enjin Coin (ENJ) between Ethereum and JumpNet
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to send and receive ENJ and ERC-1155 tokens for free
        > Use the Enjin Platform to mint ERC-1155 tokens, no gas required
        > Use the Enjin Marketplace to trade ERC-1155 tokens without gas fees
        > Use our API to automatically distribute ERC-1155 tokens from your app or game
        > Use Enjin Beam to distribute ERC-1155 tokens via QR codes for free*
