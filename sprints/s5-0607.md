## Smart Contracts

- [x] [Smart Contract Design Patterns](https://medium.com/@i6mi6/solidty-smart-contracts-design-patterns-ecfa3b1e9784)
- [x] [ERC standards](https://101blockchains.com/erc-standards/) (2018):
    * ERC-20: Fungible token standard
    * [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): Non-fungible token standard. Transfer and track NFTs
        * examples: physical property, virtual collectables, and _negative value_ assets: loans etc.
        * no two houses are alike. ownership of each NFT must be tracked separately
        * wallet/broker app MUST implement wallet interface `ERC721TokenReceiver` for safe transfers.
        * NFT **identifiers** are uinque `uin256` and is not changed for entire life of the contract/NFT. `(address, tokenID)` pair must be globally unique and full-qualified.
        * callers shall not assume that ID numbers have a pattern to them.
        * transfer implmentations can pause trnasfers, blacklist receiving address , disallow unsafe trnasfers, charge fees two ways and readonly NFT registries.
    * [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165): Method standard. Publishing/Detecting interfaces that a smart contract uses.
        * every ERC721 must implement ERC165.
        * _interfaces_ defined broadly as all functions in an ABI - a subset of the Solidity `interface`
        * checking if implementing contract fp mathes fp of given interface with `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)`
        * i.e. if a contract implements ERC165, it will have a `supportsInterface` function that lets you query it if it has a given interface, and what version of interface.
    * ERC-223: allows contract to decline tokens. prevents accidental burning of non-supported tokens - still open
    * ~~ERC-621: introduce modifying token supply using `increaseSupply` and `decreaseSupply`~~ closed
    * [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777):  identify receipt of token, allows receiver to reject tokens from a blacklist address or decline payment.
        * improvement on ERC20 for _fungible_ tokens
        * requires [ERC-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) as a universal contract registry (which contract, which interface) - compatible with ERC-165
        * _operators_ (special, trusted contracts) send tokens on behalf of contracts, and react with _hooks_  for token holders to control sending/receipt.
        * contracts/addresses register sendable/receiveable tokens.
        * removes decimals - all amounts and balances is stored as denomination of E-18, decimal places fixed at 18.
        * Minting and Burning events
        * [OpenZep](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc777)
    * ERC-827: extension on ee3. Token holders can transfer or approve 3rd party spending. - draft
    * ERC-884:  Tokenized stocks including KYC of holders, recording regulator mandate, record transfer of shares with off-chain database - draft.
    * ERC-865: Pay transfers in token itself, instead of separate currency of gas (ETH).
    * ERC 1155: fungible + non-fungible
        * multiple token types in a single contract
        * semi-fungibles and transmutation between the two.
        * batch transfers in a single txn.
        * 1155 tokens cannot be accidentally locked in unsupported contracts
        * triggers with events `onERC1155Received`
        * stores metadata in URI - no need to store in token itself. infinite token URIs, no need to store this data on-chain.
        * rich events for mint, burn, transfer, approval and metadata changes.

## NFTs

ERC 1155 seems to be mostly implemented by Enjin projects, since it was founded by Enjin.

- [x] Enjin launches [JumpNet](https://enjin.io/software/jumpnet): NFTs with no gas fees.
    * free gas powered by [Efinity / $EFI](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/efinity-parachain) Parachain on polkadot.
    - [x] [Efinity whitepaper](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/introduction)
        * _Efinity’s purpose is to be an NFT highway, not a general computing blockchain._
        * Paratoken standard accepts tokens from any other chains including ERC721,1155,20 - interoperable with entire polkadot eco.
        * grouped NFTs - NFTs part of a family with same based ID.
        * Efniity to scale to 700-1000 tps, confirmation in 6 seconds.
    * Note: Enjin Jumpnet lets you choose **zero-fee txns for your ERC1155**. Fees are paid in JENJ tokens if charged.
        * aisde from that, standard minting functionality: supply distribution, burn controls etc.
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to move Enjin Coin (ENJ) between Ethereum and JumpNet
        > Use your Enjin Wallet to send and receive ENJ and ERC-1155 tokens for free
        > Use the Enjin Platform to mint ERC-1155 tokens, no gas required
        > Use the Enjin Marketplace to trade ERC-1155 tokens without gas fees
        > Use our API to automatically distribute ERC-1155 tokens from your app or game
        > Use Enjin Beam to distribute ERC-1155 tokens via QR codes for free*

- [x] [8.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMnBl0g3Ev4) Public Policy
   * Global approach to crypto finance: 
   * 1. guarding against illicit activities
      * tax compliance & reporting: is it currency or property?
      * Bank Secrecy Act: KYC & AML. CTF (Counter Terrorism finance).
      * challenges: pseudonymous addresses, privacy coins/tumbling/mixing, compliance and reporting. + crypto-to-crypto transactions. 
      * dark markets on TOR e.g. Silk Road. 
   * 2. financial stability:
      * capital control (restricting tradable pairs to central currency) to maintain stability. crypto allows indirect conversation of RMB -> electricity -> BTC -> USD. 
   * 3. protecting the investing public:
      * full & fair disclosure from issuers
      * fraud & deceptives sales practices
      * secondary markets w/ price transparency and anti-manipulation
      * advisor conflict of interest disclosure
   - [x] [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp): citrus groves can be a security, not an investment contract.
      * 1. investment of money or assets?
      * 2. is the investment a common enterprise - is a group of devs with open source a common enterprise?
      * 3. is there reasonable expectation of profits? - profits as an _expectation of appreciation_ of asset
      * 4. is it reliant on the promotion of others?

- [x] [9.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPJ8oQ99r9c) Permissioned v Permissionless 
   * Permissioned
      * Known set of participants - limited only to authorized nodes
      * No mining or POW needed
      * No need for native curency
      * Distributed database tech
      * deployed on IBM Hyperledger, R3 Corda
      * Favored by financial sectors\*\*
      * Do have consensus (Hyperledger: PBFT, R3: Delegated Notary nodes) but within limited group either globally in network or just between txnting nodes. 
      * Does not have POW/51% protection.
   * Permissionless
      * Unknown participants
      * Security based on incentives from staking, mining etc. 
      * Has native currrency
      * Governed by crypto economics
   * Blockchains vs Traditional databases - **do you need a blockchain?**
      * Public blockchain: public write capability, p2p txns, removing central intermediary to remove economic rents, token economics
      * Private blockchains: private writes only, finality in append-only log, public verifiability (more than write parties), 
      * Trad database: Trusted party hosts data and CRUD. Client-server architecture.

   > the real driver of this deep recession was not the banks pulling back on credit; it was the drawback on consumer spending. Our economy is dependent on consumer spending, and home equity had been driving that. 
   > crony capitalism is not capistalism. We’ve privatized profits and socialized losses.

# L2, Sidechains, Scaling

- [x] [Avail](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-avail-by-polygon-a-robust-general-purpose-scalable-data-availability-layer-98bc9814c048) by Polygon 
   * _general-purpose, scalable data availability-focused blockchain_ shared by sidechains & off-chain scaling: e.g. Polygon SDK + Cosmos SDK + Substrate SDK
   * **sidechains/standalones can bootstrap _validator security_ with guarantee txn data availability provided by Avail. **
   * **Data Availability problem**: liteclients do not download entire blocks - can be tricked into accepting blocks whose underlying data is not available.
   * Solutions: (1) ensuraing availability of txn data, (2) esure txn ordering -  block is valid only if data is available. prevents block producers from releasing block headers without the data behind them.
   * Availability checks: light client sample small, random cunks from each block. Non-consensus nodes provider for greater secure block sizes
   * **[KZG commmitment](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html)** 
      * Data redundancy: prevents product from hiding blocks
      * Fraud proof free guarantee of correct erasure coding
      * Vector commitments allow full nodes to convince txn inclusion 
   * Application needs app-specific standalone chain - spins up new PoS using polygon/cosmos/substrate -- still needs to gain security through validator staking.
   * instead use Avail for txn ordering and dtata availability. 
   * Submit txn to polygon SDK chain -> Availa -> order is matnained in Avail. Assurance: ordered data is available and standalon chain can reconstruct app state. 
   * Other L2 solutions **move execution off-chain** while **ensuring verification and availabilty on-chain**: still limited by tps of Ethereum. 
      * Optmistic: operator may submit invalid txn. will nt be able to produce fraud-proofs due to lack of data
      * ZKIP: esnures accepted txns are valid. but zero-knowledge (not revealing data backing a txn) may lead to other validators not being able to calculate state
   * Components:
      *  data hosting and ordering: order txns without execution, store and ensure complete availability
      *  execution: execute ordered txns from Avail with checkpoint-assert-proof (CAP)
      *  verfication/dispute: process CAP, guarantees only valid state txns are accepted.
