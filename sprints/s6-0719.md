- [x] [15.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPD9fx8fK1k&t=3478s), [16.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNqMBBbb6UI) Central Banks & Commercial Banking   
  * Central Banks (stores reserves & cash) - Commercial Banks (stores bank deposits) - Public (stores money as bank deposits or cash)
  * Realtime gross settlement systems - interbank system with central bank e.g. **FedWire**, **MEPS**
  * **US Central Bank goals & functions**:
    * Fed Reserve "Dual Mandate": Price stability and maximum employment
      > Promote max employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates
      * differs. European central bank has only 1 mandate of price stability. 
      * (1) Manage Fiat Currency **Supply** 
        - [x] [Monetary Bases, M0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarybase.asp): total amount of currency in circulation either as cash, or bank deposits. 
          * M0: funds must be consoidered final settlement of a txn. e.g. Cash payments for a debt is final. Writing checks can be considered final upon clearance.  
          * M1: Money Supply from physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers checks, NOW accounts - most liquid portions of money. 
          * M1 does not include finance assets e.g. savings accoutns and bonds. 
          * M1 is not used as a guide for monetary policy due to lack of correlation with economic variables. 
          * M2, M3: Money SUply from _near money)_ are less liquid forms of money.
      * Deposits make up more money than cash - M2 of US up to $14T
      * (2) Manage Fiat Currency **Price**
        * Interest Rates, Forex Interventions & Exchange controls
    * Oversee Fractional Banking System by providing reserves, regulating _banking_ systems, promote safe _payment_ systems
    * Serve as Lender of Last Resort
    * Fiat currency is not longer backed by gold standard since 70s
    * Fiat crises are usually due to poor fiscal policy (overspending more than taxable amount, usually from war) or poor monetary policy (overprinting)
    * Banking crises leads to expanding monetary base (supply) 
  * Central Banks progress with CBDCs: Monitor & study vs Restrict vs Payment System Experimentation vs CBDC intiatives
    * CBDCs may not be relying on blockchain technology
    * Public Sector payment initiatives: EU TIPS, IN Immediate Payment Service, UK's Updated realtime gross settlment
    * Central Bank blockchain: Canada (Jasper), Brazil, SG (Ubin)
    * Ubin phases:
        * Domestic delivery vs Payment (DVP): move security and payment simultaneously with no credit risks
        * Payment vs Payment (PvP)
        * cross-border settlement of payments and securities (DvPvP)
        * Tested on Corda, Hyperledger, Quorum
    * **Ubin evalutation criteria**: 
        1. Digitization of payments
        2. Decentralized procesing
        3. Paymetn Queue handling
        4. Privacy of txns
        5. settlement finality
        6. liquidity optimization
    * Banks serve to promote the extension of credit. What happpens when they are disintermediated?

* CBDC design Considerations
    1. widely accessible vs wholesale
    2. token or account based
    3. issuer - central bank v comm banks etc
    4. degree of anonymenty
    5. transfer mechanism
    6. limits or caps
    7. interest-bearing or Level of Account services

- [ ] [Ubin V](https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/Project-Ubin): Phase 5, Final phase of Ubin using Blockchain and DLT for clearing and settlement of payment and securities
  * Phase 1: tokenized SGD, interbank prototype on private Ehtereum network with new smart contracts, integrated with MEPS+
    * Credit risk: no credit risk asociated with creation, distribution and redemption of digital SGD
    * Allowing interbank loans  wihout posting cash will optimize liquidity requirements
    * Liquidity risk: no liquidity risk even during failure or outage of largest participant. DL can coexist with conventional payments MEPS+
  * Phase 2: Reimagining RTGS: real time gross settlement
    * Corda prototype:
       * Security: ledger dsitributions on need-to-know basis isntead of global broadcast. Additional layer of Condidential identities added to each txn for identifyin pariticipants. Concerns on network member attempts to graph the nework and deduce sender/receiver. 
       * Scalabiltity: minimum to no changes on existing nodes in network due to need-to-know participation in transactions does not require new nodes to download entire archive.
       * Corda UTXO requires node to walk-the-chain to verify each input - workaround: implementing expiry(?), recycle pledge funds over period of time
       * Resiliency: Corda's Flow Checkpointing. 
         * removing bank nodes: current prototyp does not support removal of nodes
         * removing MAS: network is not affected as MAS is not required to orchestract resolution that MAS is not participanting in.
       * Finality: notary signature provides point of finality for all participants of txn. Either all txn changes are accepted, or none. Queued payments can be reprioritized or cancelled. 
     * Hyperledger: 
       * Security: **private channels (partitions)** between participants, maintains independent ledgers between each pariticipant. Txn details are only visible to pair of banks and MAS as a regulator. **Not possible for any bank to deduce total balance or liquidity of counterparty**
       * It is possible for network participants to identify the channels involved in each fund movement transaction - requires additional cryptographic security on infrastructure layer
       * Identities of banks particpatng in gridlock resultion are included per bank, but no individual txn amount exposed. 
       * Scalability: requires N nodes x N-1/2 + M channels. For 10 banks, requires 47 channels. # of channels  increase with every new participants. 
       * Due to individual bilateral channels, banks need to run own nodes to continuously move funds between channels with _fund movement algos_ with e.g. Kafka listeners.
       * Resiliency: SPOF due to having only one ordered to send txns to all peers in a channel. Workaround: using HA multinode ordering service e.g. Kafka
       * Removing 1 participating node during gridlock results in failed proposals, banks require multinode setup for resiliency
       * REmoving MAS during gridlock also results in failure due to dependency for MAS to provide blanaces and settle queues across all bilateral channels
       * Finality: peers in endorsement policy provide endorsement and ordered into block to broadcast in channel for validation and ledger updates.
       * Commnuication between channels require additional, custom orchestration instead of within chain code.
     * Quorum: 
       * Privacy: supports both public + private txns in permissioned network. Public txns are broadcasted, private txns are sent directly to specific recipients on Constalelation as encrypted blob.
       * Private txns are viewable to others as a hash. Can be used for 3rd party confirmations of event without visibility into txn information. 
       * Uses ZKP for managing _shielded salted balance of each bank_, bank balances is only visible to itself. 
       * Scalability: using Quorum Network Manager to automate nework setup and configuration. 
       * Resilience: inherits Ethereum block propagation. Single node failures does not affect network availability - however txns with failed node is not allowed. Txn history is auotmatically resynced. 
         * Removing bank node during gridlock: remaingin nodes are able to proceed 
         * Removing MAS during gridlock: no affects, resolution not dependent on MAS. 
       * Finality: using Raft consensus model - Raft leaders commit new blocks, irreversible. Raft leader is elected during network creation, and network reelects Raft leaders during unavailablity. 
       * ZKP generation time may be a concern during gridlock resolution cycle. 
  * Phase 3: DvP on DLT with SGX

- [x] Coming Rise & Fall of [CBDCs](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency): 
  * 86% of central banks are actively researching CBDCs in 2021
   * 3 types of money: Commodities (intrinsic value from demand e.g. gold), Representative (no intrinsic value but provides claims e.g. cheques, commodity certs), Fiat (instrinsic value from government e.g. national currencies)
   * Bank notes solves divisibility/portability/fungibility of gold. Digital fiat solves the same for bank notes. Next, digital money will have intrinsic value becoming commodity money
   * Key Themes: 
      *  Store of value: central banks may subject CBDCs to inflation/debasement.
      *  Privacy and surveilance - leading to need for privacy coins and black market for cash. 
      *  Sanctions and censorship - censorship of individual activity. 
      *  Lack of switching costs for currencies - individual accesssibility to _best form of money_ for transactions. 
   *  Adoption trends: _buy with local currency_, airdropping social assistance and legal tender laws enforce CBDCs as medium of exchange.
