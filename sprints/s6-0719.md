- [x] [15.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPD9fx8fK1k&t=3478s), [16.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNqMBBbb6UI) Central Banks & Commercial Banking   
  * Central Banks (stores reserves & cash) - Commercial Banks (stores bank deposits) - Public (stores money as bank deposits or cash)
  * Realtime gross settlement systems - interbank system with central bank e.g. **FedWire**, **MEPS**
  * **US Central Bank goals & functions**:
    * Fed Reserve "Dual Mandate": Price stability and maximum employment
      > Promote max employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates
      * differs. European central bank has only 1 mandate of price stability. 
      * (1) Manage Fiat Currency **Supply** 
        - [x] [Monetary Bases, M0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarybase.asp): total amount of currency in circulation either as cash, or bank deposits. 
          * M0: funds must be consoidered final settlement of a txn. e.g. Cash payments for a debt is final. Writing checks can be considered final upon clearance.  
          * M1: Money Supply from physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers checks, NOW accounts - most liquid portions of money. 
          * M1 does not include finance assets e.g. savings accoutns and bonds. 
          * M1 is not used as a guide for monetary policy due to lack of correlation with economic variables. 
          * M2, M3: Money SUply from _near money)_ are less liquid forms of money.
      * Deposits make up more money than cash - M2 of US up to $14T
      * (2) Manage Fiat Currency **Price**
        * Interest Rates, Forex Interventions & Exchange controls
    * Oversee Fractional Banking System by providing reserves, regulating _banking_ systems, promote safe _payment_ systems
    * Serve as Lender of Last Resort
    * Fiat currency is not longer backed by gold standard since 70s
    * Fiat crises are usually due to poor fiscal policy (overspending more than taxable amount, usually from war) or poor monetary policy (overprinting)
    * Banking crises leads to expanding monetary base (supply) 
  * Central Banks progress with CBDCs: Monitor & study vs Restrict vs Payment System Experimentation vs CBDC intiatives
    * CBDCs may not be relying on blockchain technology
    * Public Sector payment initiatives: EU TIPS, IN Immediate Payment Service, UK's Updated realtime gross settlment
    * Central Bank blockchain: Canada (Jasper), Brazil, SG (Ubin)
    * Ubin phases:
        * Domestic delivery vs Payment (DVP): move security and payment simultaneously with no credit risks
        * Payment vs Payment (PvP)
        * cross-border settlement of payments and securities (DvPvP)
        * Tested on Corda, Hyperledger, Quorum
    * **Ubin evalutation criteria**: 
        1. Digitization of payments
        2. Decentralized procesing
        3. Paymetn Queue handling
        4. Privacy of txns
        5. settlement finality
        6. liquidity optimization
    * Banks serve to promote the extension of credit. What happpens when they are disintermediated?

* CBDC design Considerations
    1. widely accessible vs wholesale
    2. token or account based
    3. issuer - central bank v comm banks etc
    4. degree of anonymenty
    5. transfer mechanism
    6. limits or caps
    7. interest-bearing or Level of Account services

- [ ] [Ubin V](https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/Project-Ubin): Phase 5, Final phase of Ubin using Blockchain and DLT for clearing and settlement of payment and securities
  * Phase 1: tokenized SGD, interbank prototype on private Ehtereum network with new smart contracts, integrated with MEPS+
    * Credit risk: no credit risk asociated with creation, distribution and redemption of digital SGD
    * Allowing interbank loans  wihout posting cash will optimize liquidity requirements
    * Liquidity risk: no liquidity risk even during failure or outage of largest participant. DL can coexist with conventional payments MEPS+
  * Phase 2: Reimagining RTGS: real time gross settlement
    * Corda prototype:
       * Security: ledger dsitributions on need-to-know basis isntead of global broadcast. Additional layer of Condidential identities added to each txn for identifyin pariticipants. Concerns on network member attempts to graph the nework and deduce sender/receiver. 
       * Scalabiltity: minimum to no changes on existing nodes in network due to need-to-know participation in transactions does not require new nodes to download entire archive.
       * Corda UTXO requires node to walk-the-chain to verify each input - workaround: implementing expiry(?), recycle pledge funds over period of time
       * Resiliency: Corda's Flow Checkpointing. 
         * removing bank nodes: current prototyp does not support removal of nodes
         * removing MAS: network is not affected as MAS is not required to orchestract resolution that MAS is not participanting in.
       * Finality: notary signature provides point of finality for all participants of txn. Either all txn changes are accepted, or none. Queued payments can be reprioritized or cancelled. 
     * Hyperledger: 
       * Security: **private channels (partitions)** between participants, maintains independent ledgers between each pariticipant. Txn details are only visible to pair of banks and MAS as a regulator. **Not possible for any bank to deduce total balance or liquidity of counterparty**
       * It is possible for network participants to identify the channels involved in each fund movement transaction - requires additional cryptographic security on infrastructure layer
       * Identities of banks particpatng in gridlock resultion are included per bank, but no individual txn amount exposed. 
       * Scalability: requires N nodes x N-1/2 + M channels. For 10 banks, requires 47 channels. # of channels  increase with every new participants. 
       * Due to individual bilateral channels, banks need to run own nodes to continuously move funds between channels with _fund movement algos_ with e.g. Kafka listeners.
       * Resiliency: SPOF due to having only one ordered to send txns to all peers in a channel. Workaround: using HA multinode ordering service e.g. Kafka
       * Removing 1 participating node during gridlock results in failed proposals, banks require multinode setup for resiliency
       * REmoving MAS during gridlock also results in failure due to dependency for MAS to provide blanaces and settle queues across all bilateral channels
       * Finality: peers in endorsement policy provide endorsement and ordered into block to broadcast in channel for validation and ledger updates.
       * Commnuication between channels require additional, custom orchestration instead of within chain code.
     * Quorum: 
       * Privacy: supports both public + private txns in permissioned network. Public txns are broadcasted, private txns are sent directly to specific recipients on Constalelation as encrypted blob.
       * Private txns are viewable to others as a hash. Can be used for 3rd party confirmations of event without visibility into txn information. 
       * Uses ZKP for managing _shielded salted balance of each bank_, bank balances is only visible to itself. 
       * Scalability: using Quorum Network Manager to automate nework setup and configuration. 
       * Resilience: inherits Ethereum block propagation. Single node failures does not affect network availability - however txns with failed node is not allowed. Txn history is auotmatically resynced. 
         * Removing bank node during gridlock: remaingin nodes are able to proceed 
         * Removing MAS during gridlock: no affects, resolution not dependent on MAS. 
       * Finality: using Raft consensus model - Raft leaders commit new blocks, irreversible. Raft leader is elected during network creation, and network reelects Raft leaders during unavailablity. 
       * ZKP generation time may be a concern during gridlock resolution cycle. 
  * Phase 3: DvP on DLT with SGX

- [x] Coming Rise & Fall of [CBDCs](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency): 
  * 86% of central banks are actively researching CBDCs in 2021
   * 3 types of money: Commodities (intrinsic value from demand e.g. gold), Representative (no intrinsic value but provides claims e.g. cheques, commodity certs), Fiat (instrinsic value from government e.g. national currencies)
   * Bank notes solves divisibility/portability/fungibility of gold. Digital fiat solves the same for bank notes. Next, digital money will have intrinsic value becoming commodity money
   * Key Themes: 
      *  Store of value: central banks may subject CBDCs to inflation/debasement.
      *  Privacy and surveilance - leading to need for privacy coins and black market for cash. 
      *  Sanctions and censorship - censorship of individual activity. 
      *  Lack of switching costs for currencies - individual accesssibility to _best form of money_ for transactions. 
   *  Adoption trends: _buy with local currency_, airdropping social assistance and legal tender laws enforce CBDCs as medium of exchange. 

- [x] [The Kimchi Premium](https://phemex.com/academy/kimchi-premium-crypto-price-tracker): prices of crypto in KR are markedly higher, 4.73% on average
  *  driven by South Korea’s capital controls restricting capital flowing in and out of the country
  *  time-consuming and difficult to move dececntralized currencies plus limitations on residents from using international exchanges
     *  BTC is considered commodity and subjected to taxation
     *  BTC-KRW is not directly tradeable and exchange for BTC-USD-KRW is slow and risky
     *  Transaction fees from arbitrage
  *  In bear markets, Kimchi premiums may turn into kimchi discounts.
  *  Tightened crypto trading regulations in 2021 may persist the kimchi premium - exchanges given deadline Sept 2021 for full compliance.
     *  requirements include exchanges to form partnerships with local banks, which may charge a fee for certification
     *  inaccessible for the current 200 exchanges in KR. concentration of compliant exchanges will exacerbate the problem.

- [x] [The Money Flower](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709z.htm)
  * ![money flower](/assets/money-flower.jpeg)
  * Different forms of money based on traits of: 
    * universally-accessible
    * electronic/digital form
    * central-bank issued
    * peer-to-peer or token-based
  * [Fedcoin](http://www.fedcoin.net/) project has all attributes as a CBDC - US Gov sponsored cryptocurrency
  * Sweden's CBDC: [eKrona](https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/e-krona-sweden-cbdc/)
    * Swedes are _ already one of the most cash-free societies on earth_, only 12% of small payments are done in cash. 
    * BankID provides access to digital finance services
    * _ CBDCs may help bring millions of people into the global financial system, they won’t bring financial freedom to them_ due to traceability

- [x] [19.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWpQpPbo7rM), [20.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EXcHqLg7BI) Primary Markets, ICOs and VCs
    * ICOs: fundraising, building networks - tokens issued before functional prototypes. Development is centralized and promoters are rewarded premined tokens. 
    * VCs do hybrid investments: mix of equity and tokens
    * How ICOs are accounted for? Depends on the revenue model and ownership. 
      * XRP - distributed 20%, kept 80% and subsequently slowly-selling. **Their revenue model is from selling XRP**, and later building the prototype for a use-case. 
    * **Evaluating ICOs:**
      * Strategy: Value proposition, problem/painpoint, competitors and **why blockchain AND native token** is a solution?
      * Techonology: Which costs of verifiaction/networking can be reduced, what txns need append-only, which stakeholders need read/write to ledgers, and customer interface vs current/traditional interface
      * What tradeoffs are necessary? Scalability, performance, privacy, interoperatability, coorditinaion
      * Can a private blockchain or traditional database be used?
      * How can broad adoption be realized?
    * (2018) ICOs by stats: 23% Infrastructure, 20.3% Finance, 9.6% Comms, 7.7% Tradigin/investing, etc. 
    * 76% of ICOs are raised at Ideation stage. Only 1.7% with code, 1.3% with fully functioning product
    * Investor protection - beyond Consumer Protection. addressing asymmetry of information between investor and issuer.  Market integrity in transparent orders.
    * Ethereum when first promoted passed the Howey Test - you want it to fail a Howey Test to not be regulated as a security. Ethereum now fails the Howey Test because it now has a functioning network. 
    - [x] [Telegram](https://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-enforcement/telegram-to-pay-back-investors-12b-for-failed-ico/29129.article) among largest ICOs $1.2B arised in 2018, but sued by SEC due to security classification as ill-gotten gains.
    * Jurisdiction applies when it affects their citizens, exchanges/secondary market or the issuer. 
    * 86% of ICOs listed in 2017 are trading below listing price, of which 30% lost substantially all value
    * Only 13% have working products and 16% have prototypes
    * DApps in 2018: 179 Exchanges, 488 Gambling, 466 Games, 228 Finance
      *  in 2021: From [DAppRadar report](https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-industry-report-q2-2021-overview): 
        * Ethereum TVL surpassed $53.3B with AAVE, uuniswap, curve increased 70.31% QoQ
        * Pancakeswap driving BSC value; TVL increased by 32.8%
        * Axie Infinity (Gaming) growing 360.61% QoQ
        * Polygon surpassing Ethereum by unique active wallets, AAVE TVL on Polygon $2B - equivalent to 22% of Ethereum TVL, and same numbers with Sushi on Polygon
