- [x] [15.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPD9fx8fK1k&t=3478s) Central Banks & Commercial Banking   
  * Central Banks (stores reserves & cash) - Commercial Banks (stores bank deposits) - Public (stores money as bank deposits or cash)
  * Realtime gross settlement systems - interbank system with central bank e.g. **FedWire**
  * **US Central Bank goals & functions**:
    * Fed Reserve "Dual Mandate": Price stability and maximum employment
      > Promote max employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates
      * differs. European central bank has only 1 mandate of price stability. 
      * (1) Manage Fiat Currency **Supply** 
        - [x] [Monetary Bases, M0](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarybase.asp): total amount of currency in circulation either as cash, or bank deposits. 
          * M0: funds must be consoidered final settlement of a txn. e.g. Cash payments for a debt is final. Writing checks can be considered final upon clearance.  
          * M1: Money Supply from physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers checks, NOW accounts - most liquid portions of money. 
          * M1 does not include finance assets e.g. savings accoutns and bonds. 
          * M1 is not used as a guide for monetary policy due to lack of correlation with economic variables. 
          * M2, M3: Money SUply from _near money)_ are less liquid forms of money.
      * Deposits make up more money than cash - M2 of US up to $14T
      * (2) Manage Fiat Currency **Price**
        * Interest Rates, Forex Interventions & Exchange controls
    * Oversee Fractional Banking System by providing reserves, regulating _banking_ systems, promote safe _payment_ systems
    * Serve as Lender of Last Resort
    * Fiat currency is not longer backed by gold standard since 70s
    * Fiat crises are usually due to poor fiscal policy (overspending more than taxable amount, usually from war) or poor monetary policy (overprinting)
    * Banking crises leads to expanding monetary base (supply) 
  * Central Banks progress with CBDCs: Monitor & study vs Restrict vs Payment System Experimentation vs CBDC intiatives
    * CBDCs may not be relying on blockchain technology
    * Public Sector payment initiatives: EU TIPS, IN Immediate Payment Service, UK's Updated realtime gross settlment
    * Central Bank blockchain: Canada (Jasper), Brazil, SG (Ubin)
    * Ubin phases:
        * Domestic delivery vs Payment (DVP): move security and payment simultaneously with no credit risks
        * Payment vs Payment (PvP)
        * cross-border settlement of payments and securities (DvPvP)
        * Tested on Corda, Hyperledger, Quorum
    * **Ubin evalutation criteria**: 
        1. Digitization of payments
        2. Decentralized procesing
        3. Paymetn Queue handling
        4. Privacy of txns
        5. settlement finality
        6. liquidity optimization
    * Banks serve to promote the extension of credit. What happpens when they are disintermediated?
  * **CBDC design Considerations**
      1. widely accessible vs wholesale
      2. token or account based
      3. issuer - central bank v comm banks etc
      4. degree of anonymenty
      5. transfer mechanism
      6. limits or caps
      7. interest-bearing or Level of Account services

- [x] Coming Rise & Fall of [CBDCs](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency): 
  * 86% of central banks are actively researching CBDCs in 2021
   * 3 types of money: Commodities (intrinsic value from demand e.g. gold), Representative (no intrinsic value but provides claims e.g. cheques, commodity certs), Fiat (instrinsic value from government e.g. national currencies)
   * Bank notes solves divisibility/portability/fungibility of gold. Digital fiat solves the same for bank notes. Next, digital money will have intrinsic value becoming commodity money
   * Key Themes: 
      *  Store of value: central banks may subject CBDCs to inflation/debasement.
      *  Privacy and surveilance - leading to need for privacy coins and black market for cash. 
      *  Sanctions and censorship - censorship of individual activity. 
      *  Lack of switching costs for currencies - individual accesssibility to _best form of money_ for transactions. 
   *  Adoption trends: _buy with local currency_, airdropping social assistance and legal tender laws enforce CBDCs as medium of exchange.
