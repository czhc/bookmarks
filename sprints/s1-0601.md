## Proof of Work & Bitcoin origins

- [ ] Nakamoto, Satoshi. Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper [email](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html), [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
   * The network timestamps transaction by hashing them into an ongoing chain forming a record that connect be changed without redoing the proof
   * Transactions that are _computationally impractical to reverse_ protects sellers from fraud. _as long as honest nodes control more CPU than attackers_
   * 
   * Nodes leave/rejoin and accept the longest POW chain as proof.

Interactive proofs are limited in transferability - requires repetition of process of proof. 
Non-interactive proofs do not require interaction between prover and verfier.

### Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof zk-SNARK 

* succinct: fast (milliseconds), proof of length within 100-bytes
* non-interactive: single message from prover to verfier
* argument of knowledge:
