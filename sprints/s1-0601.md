Interactive proofs are limited in transferability - requires repetition of process of proof. 
Non-interactive proofs do not require interaction between prover and verfier.

### Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof zk-SNARK 

* succinct: fast (milliseconds), proof of length within 100-bytes
* non-interactive: single message from prover to verfier
* argument of knowledge:
