## Proof of Work & Bitcoin origins

- [x] Nakamoto, Satoshi. Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper [email](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html), [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
   * The network timestamps transaction by hashing them into an ongoing chain forming a record that connect be changed without redoing the proof
   * Transactions that are _computationally impractical to reverse_ protects sellers from fraud. _as long as honest nodes control more CPU than attackers_
   * Nodes leave/rejoin and accept the longest POW chain as proof.
   * POW assumes that all nodes have equal computing power, so a bad actor needs to have significantly more computation power than a majority to invalidate the block AND all succeeding blocks in the chain
   * Incentives: 
      1. Mined value: first txn in any block mints a new _coin_ in the currency
      2. Txn fees based on output value - input value. When coin supply has depleted, incentives move completely to fees
      3. Game theory: (i) Spend CPU to defraud network vs. (ii) spend CPU to participate in network
         - if transacted amount / reward to defaud (i) is significantly greater than reward in (ii), is this a valid check/balance?
  * Verification based on: 
      i. merkle branch links to txn with block timestamp, verifying block header from longest chain 
      ii. proof of acceptance of valid block - has succeeding blocks. 
  * How are bitcoin txns divisble? [wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction)
      > an Input just a **reference to an Output from a previous txn**. A current wallet's balance the sum of all Inputs i.e. sum of all Outputs from multiple txns pointing to the wallet's address. 
     * ![Transaction](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/6/67/Transaction.png)
  * Probability of attacker catching up to # of blocks of honest nodes (_q\_z_) drops off exponentially by the number of attached blocks _z_. see Poisson proof
  - [x] [Gambler's ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin): 
     > a gambler persistently plays a negative expected-value (least likely, least fair) game will lose regardless of their betting system.
     > i.e. double-down bets are faster to deplete to zero.

Interactive proofs are limited in transferability - requires repetition of process of proof. 
Non-interactive proofs do not require interaction between prover and verfier.

### Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof zk-SNARK 

* succinct: fast (milliseconds), proof of length within 100-bytes
* non-interactive: single message from prover to verfier
* argument of knowledge:

   * Movements to asset ratio results in IL which is always a negative value. The idea is to offset this by gain in fees.
   * Factors in choosing a profitable LP:
      * Daily Volume (V) and protocol fees (take %) per txn
      * Pool size/reserves (R) - low reserves have high slippage and so volatile price ratio movements. 
      * Pool whales: unique LP holders that control 50% of pool 
      * V/R ratio: ideally increasing or constant over time
