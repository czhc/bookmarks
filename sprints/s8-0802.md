  *  _All pending transactions waiting to be packaged are exposed to the dark forest in the mempool. Attackers can see and trace every transaction, every internal contract call, and every instruction, and perform the most common on-chain attacks, such as **front-running and sandwich attacks**._
  *  Two key points for on-chain attacks:
    *   Design and implmenetation of mempool - all txns must be sent into here instead of directly packaged by miners. 
    *   Blockchain block time duration provides execution time for attackers e.g. Ethereum avg block time ([13s](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime)), Polygon ([2s](https://polygonscan.com/chart/blocktime))
  *  MEV predators include miners (packaging , reordering, ignoring txns) and non-miners e.g. arbitrage/liquidation bots. Miners have more control vs non-miners are playing a gas war. 
  *  **Attack strategies**:
    * front-running & back-running - Taichi Network
    * sandwich attacks - Flashbots
    * time-bandit attacks - Optimism

Solution designs to MEV:

### (1) MEV Extraction
via:

* Confidential Txns: storing txns in a **private mempool**
  * 
* FRaaS: Front-Running as a Service extracts MEV and redistributes profits. 
* MEV Auction: Miner's rights of txn choosing and ordering are split, miners have right to order/include txns while the auction winner have right to reorder txns and insert their own.
