  *  _All pending transactions waiting to be packaged are exposed to the dark forest in the mempool. Attackers can see and trace every transaction, every internal contract call, and every instruction, and perform the most common on-chain attacks, such as **front-running and sandwich attacks**._
  *  Two key points for on-chain attacks:
     *   Design and implmenetation of mempool - all txns must be sent into here instead of directly packaged by miners. 
     *   Blockchain block time duration provides execution time for attackers e.g. Ethereum avg block time ([13s](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime)), Polygon ([2s](https://polygonscan.com/chart/blocktime))
  *  MEV predators include miners (packaging , reordering, ignoring txns) and non-miners e.g. arbitrage/liquidation bots. Miners have more control vs non-miners are playing a gas war. 
  *  **Attack strategies**:
     * front-running & back-running - Taichi Network
     * sandwich attacks - Flashbots
     * time-bandit attacks - Optimism
  
Solution designs to MEV:

### (1) MEV Extraction
via:

* Confidential Txns: storing txns in a **private mempool**
  * 
* FRaaS: Front-Running as a Service extracts MEV and redistributes profits. 
* MEV Auction: Miner's rights of txn choosing and ordering are split, miners have right to order/include txns while the auction winner have right to reorder txns and insert their own.

## Data & Oracles

- [x] What is the blockchain [oracle problem](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/)? 
  * The Oracle Problem - blockchains are isolated networks, self-contained and can only answer questions related to its ledger. Use-cases requiring external data (market information, IoT and web data etc.) are bridged with oracles. Oracles operate both on-and-off chain.
  * Oracle functions include: 
    * Listening to blockchain network for requests for off-chain data
    * Extract data from external systems e.g. off-chain APIs  
    * Format external API data as inputs into a blockchain and vice versa
    * Validate performance of an oracle service using cryptographic proofs
    * Off-chain computation e.g. calculating a media or generating VRF to reduce gas costs on-chain
    * Broadcast signed txns to send data and proofs for smart contracts
    * Output data to external systems e.g. relaying paymen instructions to a payment network
  * Why blockchains alone can't solve the oracle problem at a base layer:
    * blockchains cannot answer subjective or external data questions e.g. _What is the market price of BTC?_.  
    * self-contained for security
    * cannot guarantee quality of data - which is better addressed by price aggregators 
    * not scalable - requires large scale coordination for all nodes to adress and upgrade software. 
  * Centralized oracles introduce SPOFs
  * Chainlink as a network of decentralized oracle networks (DON)s: 
    * open source
    * external adapters - securely stores 3rd party API credentials 
    * decentralized - at node and data source level for highly-available, timely data retrievals and manipulation-resistant
    * data signing - using cryptographically signed data to identify and proof performance of nodes
    * service agreements using binding on-chain agreements that reward/penalizes based on node performance to guarantee quality of off-chain requests
    * reputation systems provide visibility into node performance by metrics e.g. jobs performed, clients served, avg response time
    * certification services - enabling nodes to increase seuciryt/reliability scores by obtaining certificates for KYC, geographic location, security reviews
    * flexibility to suppport advanced cryptography and hardware

## Inflation

- [x] The [Triffin Dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1011/how-the-triffin-dilemma-affects-currencies.aspx)
  * _The dollar could not survive as the world's reserve currency without requiring the United States to run ever-growing deficits. _
  * _A popular reserve currency lifts its exchange rate, which hurts the currency-issuing country's exports, leading to a trade deficit_
  * _The more popular the reserve currency vs other currencies, the higher its exchange rate and the less competitive domestic exporting industries become_ - resulting in trade deficit in the issuing country. Inversely, if the issuing country focuses on domestic monetary policy by restricting currency issuance, will result in the rest of world being unhappy.
  * Dollars are pumped into world economy thru post-war programs e.g. Marshall Plan (aid EU countries tas a result of WW II)
  * If another currency becomes the reserve of choice, _the dollar would likely depreciate relative to other currencies, which could boost exports and lower the trade deficit._. CN central bank would have to relax regulations related to CNY-denominated bonds.
  * Potential solution: a new international monetary system - reserve asset maintained by a global instutition like the IMF.
  * Unlikely to change, given the outcome of the **euro**. 

- [x] 4 ways to [measure inflation](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/09/23/4-ways-to-measure-inflation/)
  1. Consumer Price Index CPI - prices of foods & service the average consumer buys collected by bureau of labor statistics BLS
  2. CPI - food and energy i.e. _core_ number: leaves out food and energy prices, may not reflect long term pressures, influenced by short term factor e.g. weather
  3. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) or _consumer spending_ - claculated by Bureau of Economic Analysis - calculates GDP. Same inputs as CPI, consistent with CPI. CPI adjsuts for social sec payments and used as rate for financial contracts. CPI tends to report higher inflation values. 
  4. PCE - food and energy i.e. _core PCE_ - used by Fed to set inflation target.

- [x] The [**Steel Man**](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/) Technique: How to argue better
  * _building the best form of the other side’s argument and then engaging with it_
  * _being charitable and patching up the weaknesses in the other side’s proposition so that he can bring the best counter-argument to your point of view._
  * _Turing test, a computer tries to pass off as a human_
  * **Ideological Turing Test**: If you can state opposing views as clearly and persuasive as your opponents, you pass. You’re as good an emissary of that idea as anyone.
  * As John Stuart Mill said, _"he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that."_
