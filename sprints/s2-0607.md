    - [ ] Cryptographic primitives: **(1) hash functions** for tamper resistance/integrity and (2) **digital signatures using asymm encryption** for  consent. [[overview](https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/differences-between-hash-functions-symmetric-asymmetric-algorithms)]
    * ![crypto-algos](../assets/crypto-algos.png)
    * Blockchain primitives - crytography and consensus
    * components of a block: 
        * Header: hash of previous block + timestamp + nonce + **merket root hash**
        * Own Hash Header
        * Txn list    
    * Solving the puzzle: having a **certain number of leading zeros**. It doesn't mean having the exact, identical hash. 
    
    >
    > The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits.
    >
    > Avg work required is exponential to the number of zero bits required. W=e^n
    > Merkle tree is a binary tree of hashes.
    * Merkle tree: [hash of hashes of blocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp) for quick, mathematical verification
    * The [merkle root of a block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6gLY-1G4Mc), which is the hash of all hashes of all txns, contains info on all txns in the block.
    * One branch of a hash tree can be donwloaded and verified immediately even without the whole tree. Only small blocks of data need to be redownloaded and quickly checked. 
    * Any modified txn will change the value of the Merkle root of the block, and so the integrity of the block.
    * For an odd # of txns (2n-1) in a block, the last txn pair is duplicated for L1 hash to have 2 leafs

## General News

- [x] Rundown on FBI "recovery" of DarkSide Colonial Pipeline [hack](https://dossier.substack.com/p/the-colonial-pipeline-hack-the-russians)
    * DOJ claims to have _hijacked DarkSide's Bitcoin wallet_ to seize 63.7 BTC.
    * DOJ actually traced and issued warrant to a custodian wallet based in NorCal, most likely an exchange. 
    * Note that US-regulated exchanges are KYC-ed and do not serve Russian users (DarkSide is allegedly Russian)
