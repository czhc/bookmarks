    *  Sustainability - icreasing inflow of ETH deposits by increasing demand for axies purchased with SLP / breeding burns SLP. 
    *  Assumption: new ETH deposit driven by new players. Market risk from slow net new plaer. 
    *  Increasing demand:

         *  release Axie to create power-up creates supply sink
         *  soulbound axies - non-transfeable and minimized upfront investment (?) to increase pvp core
         *  collection goals - collect-all gameplay
         *  cosmetic customization
         *  virtual pet mechanism
