## How to DeFi

- [x] Where does [yield](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1433477640019750914.html) come from?
   * Yield in DeFi is to:
      * incentivize providing liquidity to a market
      * pooling votes 
      * locking up assets (reducing asset removing from trade volatility)
   * Incentivize with team/project tokens, with expectation of future price of token, or less commonly: fee capture and payout for above behavior. Fee capture strategies expect that payouts will be self-sufficient from future fees. 
   * Yield farming: high risk high yeild farms end up collapsing. 
   * Risk: protocol established, single admin key, payout rate continuity, payout from protocol revenue or just token ephemeral value, audits, substantial liquidity (selling all yield without slippage), IL risk, staked asset risks, L1 risk
   * yield farms from older protocols with actual revenue are more likely to last, and more accurate indicator of earnings. 
   * Event yield opps with expected 5-30% expected APY are actually speculating on future value of yield farm token.
   * In terms of real revenue dsitributed only xSUSHI has scalable rev distribution @ 6% APY. 
   * 200% yield may only last a few hours, 20% APY may only last a few days.  

## Gaming

- [x] Is [Axie Infinity](https://axiepulse.substack.com/p/is-axie-infinity-sustainable) Sustainable?
    *  Sustainability - icreasing inflow of ETH deposits by increasing demand for axies purchased with SLP / breeding burns SLP. 
    *  Assumption: new ETH deposit driven by new players. Market risk from slow net new plaer. 
    *  Increasing demand: 
         *  land - virtual world, MMORPG style gameplay
         *  release Axie to create power-up creates supply sink
         *  soulbound axies - non-transfeable and minimized upfront investment (?) to increase pvp core
         *  collection goals - collect-all gameplay
         *  cosmetic customization
         *  virtual pet mechanism
