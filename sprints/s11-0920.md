#### Solana Key innovations

- [x] [PoH](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274): Clock for blockchain

* Participants in an adversarial system can't trust an external source of time or timestamps in a message
	- **hashgraph uses a median timestamp**: each message travels to supermajority of network and collects signatures. 
	
* PoH - high frequency Verfiable Delay Function - request a specific number of sequential steps, produce unique, verifiable output
	- [VDFs](https://dci.mit.edu/vdfday) - unbiasable randomness and proxy for passage of time. 
	- [x] [ToB](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/12/introduction-to-verifiable-delay-functions-vdfs/): VDFs
		* Future block hashes, block difficulty or timestamps are not true random values, can be manipulated by miner. 
		* A miner that is able to influence or predict randomness can affect how they are chosen to mine a block in PoS. 
	* VDFs requires moderate amount of sequential computation (time delay) imposed on a pseurandom generator.
	* Exponentially more time to compute (even in parallel processor) than on single processor
	* No party can distinguish output of f(x) from random - **sequentiality**
	* 3 candidates of VDFs: injecive rational maps (weak VDFs) and two separate candidates using repeated squaring
	* Ethereum and Chia are also looking into using BDFs for consensus algorithms
* PoH: use sequential pre-image hash that runs over itself with previous out as next input - ensures real time has passed between each counter. 
* Impossible to create an input that would collide with desired hash in the future. 
	- Prove that time passed between any two append operations and data was created sometime before it was appended
	- If a message contains a 0x------ hash, we know it was generated after a given count.
* Recording sequence can only be generated on single core, but verification can be done in parallel.

- [x] Sealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time

* EVM and EOS runtimes are WASM-based, single threaded. Sealevel process 10,000s contracts in parallels allowing using multiple cores in validator
* Solana txns describe all states a txn will read or write - allows non-overlapping txn to run concurrently and read-only txns to run concurrently
* Cloudbreak ledger maps public keys to accounts (balances and data). 
	* Programs / Smart contracts - only debit accounts they own, change data of accounts they own. Any program can credit or read an account.
	* All accounts start as owned by the _System Program_.
	* Loaders load user-defined programs, marks data in accounts as executable, verified bytecode.

* **Transactions / instructions tells the VM which accounts it will be reading/writing to ahead of time.**
	* sort millions of pending transacitons
	* schedule all **non-overlapping txns in parallel**
	
* SIMD (Single instruction, multiple data) parallel processing - sort instructions by program ID, run program over all accounts concurrently. based on CUDA architecture. 
	* If **incoming txns all call the same program instructions** (smart contract method) - solana can **execute all txns conccurently over all available cores**. 
	* multipprocessing is **bound by slowest path execution in the batch**.
