## NFT

- [x] Decentralized [Crypto Domains](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/decentralized-crypto-domain-web-3)
    * Web 3.0 - decentralized apps - allowing pariticpating without monetizing personal data. 
    * E.g. IPFS, Arweave (AR), Filecoin (FIL). 
    * Decentralized DNS: ENS, HSN, Unstoppable Domain, Yat
    * ENS: mapping human-readable names to eth and IPFS addresses, on Ethereum blockchain. No KYC. 300k domains registered.
    * HNS: decentralized ICANN, purchase right sto TLD on Namebase. Handshake has separate POW blockchain. 1.6M domains registered
    * UD: human-readable name from pre-exsitign TLDs to IPs. BUilt on Ethereum and Ziliqa- requires browser extensions for blockchain domains. No renewal fees. 1.2M domains registered.
    * yat: emoji domains. Centralized registary. NO renewable fees. 
    * Solana NS: Native to solanda, mapping to off/onchain destinations. No renewal fees
    * PolkaDomain: domain makretplace, xchain txn, address anonymity. Utility token NAME as currency. 
    * THORName - like UD

## How to DeFi

    * Equlibrium - active managed portfolio, paid out in YEL with diff strategy levels
        * higher risk, hiehg APY. 
        * Contract autocompounds and reallocate funds to new farms. Rewards paid out in YEL.
    * Spectre: launchpad for asset staking opps
        * listings require due-diligence
    * Centrifuge: Lottery roll
        * every 12 hours. tickets allocaed per wallet ID - up to 10 tx
        * rewards based on matching numbers - 1-no match up to 4-no match (15%) of pool
    * Governance: addresses gain +1 vote for every 3 months that 50% of tokens have not moved. 
    * Genetic (single-side staking), Genome (LP staking), Ribose (partner staking), Plasmide (B2B liquidity suport), Chromosome (xchaining)
    * Redox - collec fees from Plasmide and Ribose to buy YEL across all chains to generate buy-pressure.

### Avalanche 

- [x] [Dexalot](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/dexalot-a-new-dex-on-avalanche-with-a-central-limit-order-book): on-chain central limit order book (testnet)
    * <> serum on solana: on-chain central limit order book
    * _place orders for cryptocurrency pairs directly from their own portfolios without relinquishing the custody of their funds_
    * opposite side orders in the order book that _match the limit price_, Dexalot traverses order book and generate full or partial trades up to the quantity specified. compared to market orders, no slippage and exact price match required. spreads need to be consistently small, large volumes.  

- [x] [BENQI](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/benqi-and-avalanche-launch-3m-liquidity-mining-initiative-to-accelerate-defi-growth-2c16f78b903d)
   * Liquidity market protocol - AAVE etc. 
   * Collaterals: AVAX, ETH, LINK, wBTC, USDT, and DAI 
   * BENQI backed by Avalanche Foundation, Mechanism, Dragonfly, Spartan, Arrington $6M. 
   * Avalanche Defi $233M TVL. 
   * Pangolin (leading AMM on avalanche, 1.8B trading volume since launch)
   * [Avalanche Bridge](https://bridge.avax.network/)
   * [Benqi](https://benqi.fi/)
   * [Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/)   

- [x] Avalanche [Docs](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/transfer-avax-between-x-chain-and-c-chain)
   * AVAX tokens exist on the X-Chain, where they can be traded, on the P-Chain, where they can be provided as a stake when validating the Primary Network, and on the C-Chain, where they can be used in smart contracts or to pay for gas

## Security

- [x] [MISO](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/two-rights-might-make-a-wrong/) - 109kETH / $350M
   *  MISO platform operates two types of auctions: Dutch auctions [[contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c4564a1FE775D97297F9e3Dc2e762e0Ed5Dda0e)] and batch auctions.
   *  `initMarket`, `initAuction` functions had no access controls
   *  `BoringBatchable` mixin allows batch contract calls using `delegatecall`. Batched multiple calls to `commitETH`, reuse ETH across every commitment to allow free calls. 
      * `* @notice Checks the amount of ETH to commit and adds the commitment. Refunds the buyer if commit is too high.
      * `@param _beneficiary Auction participant ETH address.`
   *  Inside a `delegatecall`, msg.sender and msg.value are persisted.
   *  _if someone tried to exploit this bug, then there would be more commitments than there was ETH_.
   *  Takeaways: 
      * If you use msg.value to check that payment was received, you absolutely cannot place that logic in a loop - esp in complex codebase. Use wETH interface instead of using msg.value directly.  
      * safe contract-level components can be mixed in a way that produces unsafe contract-level behavior.

- [x] Dangers of [Surprising Code](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/the-dangers-of-surprising-code/)
   * tldr: `safe` functions may not necessarily have _safe_ implementations. 
   1. Hashmask re-entrancy:
      * ```
           function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) internal virtual {
             _mint(to, tokenId);
             require(_checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, _data), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
           }
         ```
       * ERC721 [_checkonERC721Received](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol): 
            * `* @dev Internal function to invoke {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} on a target address.`
            * `The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract.`
      * performs callback to token recipient to check if they are willing to accept xfer. during which, recipient has the control of orderflow and can re-enter `mintNFT` again
      * Flow: myContract -> NFTContract: `mintNFT` -> NFTcontract: `_safeMint` -> NFTcontract:`_checkOnERC721Received` -> MyContract: `onERC721Received` + (override to reenter) `mintNFT`
   2. ENS: 
      * `wrap`: mins ERC1155 token and takes custody of ENS domain
      * `_wrap`: returns hashed domain name
      * `require owner == msg.sender`, if `sender != owner(domain)` txn should revert and undo `_wrap`.
      * `_wrap` calls `_mint`: also checking that recipient is able to accept token i.e. **making unsafe external call**, allows reeentrancy
      * at time of callback: **myContract owns ERC1155 token, without owning the actual ENS domain**.
      * allows `myContract` to unwrap domain and burn ERC1155 token to access underlying ENS domain - to make domain/resolver changes.
