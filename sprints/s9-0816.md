### Solana

-  [ ] [Docs](https://docs.solana.com/introduction)
   * Objective: theoretical limit of 710k tps - similar to traditional dbs on standard gigabit network (of txn size 176 bytes)
   * theoretical upper bound 710k (1GB) - 28.4M tps (40GB network)
   * **Proof of History**

#### Proof of History

_hybrid consensus mechanism_

- [x] [explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywOYfGu4EA) video
   * _recursive, verifiable delay function to hash events and txns_
   * cryptographic timestamps, order of events as a function of time

- [ ] [Proof of History](https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history---a-clock-for-blockchain): A clock for blockchain
   * adversarial systems like blockchains: nodes can't trust and external source of tiem or message timestamps.
   * hashgraphs uses median timestampt: each message is signed and timestamped by _supermajority of network_ i.e. fair-ordering, requiring each message to travel to supermajority of nodes to collect signatures. 
   * PoH is a **Verifiable Delay Function**. 
   * Sequential SHA256 hash, using previous output as next input + record `count` and current output.

## Security

- [x] [MISO](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/two-rights-might-make-a-wrong/) - 109kETH / $350M
   *  MISO platform operates two types of auctions: Dutch auctions [[contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c4564a1FE775D97297F9e3Dc2e762e0Ed5Dda0e)] and batch auctions.
   *  `initMarket`, `initAuction` functions had no access controls
   *  `BoringBatchable` mixin allows batch contract calls using `delegatecall`. Batched multiple calls to `commitETH`, reuse ETH across every commitment to allow free calls. 
      * `* @notice Checks the amount of ETH to commit and adds the commitment. Refunds the buyer if commit is too high.
      * `@param _beneficiary Auction participant ETH address.`
   *  Inside a `delegatecall`, msg.sender and msg.value are persisted.
   *  _if someone tried to exploit this bug, then there would be more commitments than there was ETH_.
   *  Takeaways: 
      * If you use msg.value to check that payment was received, you absolutely cannot place that logic in a loop - esp in complex codebase. Use wETH interface instead of using msg.value directly.  
      * safe contract-level components can be mixed in a way that produces unsafe contract-level behavior.
- [x] [Certora](https://twitter.com/CertoraInc/status/1428103804449345538) response
   * Unfortunately, for Dutch Auction, we have only checked a call to `commitETH` ignoring that it can be called by `batch`
   *  To make sure such bugs don’t slip under our radar again, we plan to add generic rules that alert about potential “double spend” of `msg.value`.
   *  [POC](https://github.com/Certora/miso)

- [x] Dangers of [Surprising Code](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/the-dangers-of-surprising-code/)
   * tldr: `safe` functions may not necessarily have _safe_ implementations. 
   1. Hashmask re-entrancy:
      * ```
           function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) internal virtual {
             _mint(to, tokenId);
             require(_checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, _data), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
           }
         ```
       * ERC721 [_checkonERC721Received](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol): 
            * `* @dev Internal function to invoke {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} on a target address.`
            * `The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract.`
      * performs callback to token recipient to check if they are willing to accept xfer. during which, recipient has the control of orderflow and can re-enter `mintNFT` again
      * Flow: myContract -> NFTContract: `mintNFT` -> NFTcontract: `_safeMint` -> NFTcontract:`_checkOnERC721Received` -> MyContract: `onERC721Received` + (override to reenter) `mintNFT`
   2. ENS: 
      * `wrap`: mins ERC1155 token and takes custody of ENS domain
      * `_wrap`: returns hashed domain name
      * `require owner == msg.sender`, if `sender != owner(domain)` txn should revert and undo `_wrap`.
      * `_wrap` calls `_mint`: also checking that recipient is able to accept token i.e. **making unsafe external call**, allows reeentrancy
      * at time of callback: **myContract owns ERC1155 token, without owning the actual ENS domain**.
      * allows `myContract` to unwrap domain and burn ERC1155 token to access underlying ENS domain - to make domain/resolver changes.

## Crypto ESG

- [x] Lyn Alden: [Bitcoin energy](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/) consumption
   * Since the world uses over 170,000 TWh of energy per year, that means that the entire Bitcoin network, at its peak estimated consumption level, uses less than 0.1% of the world’s energy consumption. That’s for a network with 100+ million estimated users.
   *  how Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption lawyer uses bitcoin as a censorship-resistant payment
   *  Nigerian merchants and protest groups used bitcoin’s censorship-resistant payment attributes to go around FX currency blocks to carry out their business
   *  The firm Chainalysis, which is used by law enforcement to track public blockchains, has found across multiple years that only 0.50% to 2% of crypto transactions are for illegal activity, such as scams, ransomware, or drug purchases 
   *  Bitcoin security spend (miner revenue) is 1.9% / $16.5B of avg MC $854B as of 2021 (from initial 46.9% in 2011)
   *  Nic crter: BTC energy spend is equivalent of Venezuela (pop 28M)/ Austria (pop 9M) but only 0.7% of China and 1.7% of US
   * Lightning transactions are instantaneous and nearly free, and have no upper limit in how many can occur per second using state channels
   * Liquid is an open-source side chain of Bitcoin, meant for large entities like exchanges to settle bitcoins with each other in a faster and less expensive way than with base-layer transactions
   * Bitcoin miners are unusual energy consumers in the sense that they can go to wherever the energy source is off the grid. 
   * The province of Sichuan has a ton of overbuilt hydroelectric capacity. During the wet season, they produce more clean electricity than they can possibly use, and so it would otherwise be curtailed, wasted - it is cheap and nobody else is making use of it.
   * The University of Cambridge estimated that global flare gas recovery potential is 8x larger than the bitcoin network’s energy usage in 2021. 20% of produced natural gas is flared in North Dakota, rather than collected. That wasted gas alone is equivalent to tens of TWh of electricity generation per year
   * bitcoin miners using stranded gas (and stranded hydro power) are about the cleanest miners out there.
   * The flexibility of bitcoin mining allows it to fill in gaps for new clean energy technologies, to help them scale and provide a proof of concept. Oklo reuse the waste in autonomous reactors that don’t try to slow down the nuclear decay of the material. PRTI boils down wasted tires into hydrocarbon commodities, producing natural gas to generate electricity and mine bitcoin on-site.
   * Proof-of-stake is more complex: the system needs a way to punish stakers that improperly vote on the “wrong” chain, make sure stakers aren’t voting on all possible chains.
   * Attack vectors e.g. equivocation (proposing competing, indistinguishable blocks) - slashing. in POW, add more resources. with slashing - you're out of the network and your ETH is locked up. 
   * long-rnage attack: exit network as validator then go back in time and produce historical block to avoid slashing. solution: you need a checkpoint, which guarantees that you are on the right chain, which you need to get from someone who has been online for the entire period or somebody who is guaranteed to be on the right chain
   * Risk of centralization - proof-of-stake system mainly works well for stakes in private property, like corporations.
   * People focusing heavily on the environmental “E” side of ESG as it relates to Bitcoin often overlook the “SG” component- social and governance.
