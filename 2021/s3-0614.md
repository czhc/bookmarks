- [ ] Ethereum's Casper Algorithm: [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-casper-proof-stake-rewrite-rules-blockchain) [ChainSafe systems](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/ethereum-2-0-a-complete-guide-casper-and-the-beacon-chain-be95129fc6c1)
    - [ ] VB. [Slasher](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/): Punitive Proof of Stake Algorithm
- [x] [VB: Verkle trees](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html)
    * More efficient: Patricia Merkle: 1B data to 1 kB, Verkle: 1 billion data to less than 150B. 
    * [whitepaper, 2018](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf)
    * Simpler cryptography than ZKSNARK
    * Structural diff with MP tree: Verkle trees are _wider_. MP trees keep `wdith=2` , and Verkle trees: shorter proofs with more width, up to 256-1024
    * MP proofs require sister nodes at each depth (to hash parent node). **Verkle trees do not require sibling nodes, just the path**. i.e. Verkle trees optimize by scaling out/width to reduce paths. 
        * vector commitment scheme hashes _h(z1..zn) -> C_. In a **Verkle proof**, we create a short proof for these vector commit to replac ethe function of subling nodes in a MP proof. 
        * in practice, using a **polynomal commitment** as a simpler, efficient vector commitment
        - [ ] [Polynomial commitments](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html#polynomial-commitments)
        * Polynomial commmitment: a hash with additional property to check equations polynomials by check hash equestions. 
        * E.g. of polynom commits: KZG commitment and bullet-proof style commitment. KZG commitments and proof ersults in 3x more space-efficiency than simple Merkel at width = 256. 
    * Verkle tree: instead of proof each commitment along the path - **use polynom commitmnets to make a single fixed-size proof that proves all parent-child links along path for unlimited number of keys.**
    - [ ] [Verkle multiproofs](https://notes.ethereum.org/nrQqhVpQRi6acQckwm1Ryg#Proof) using random evaluation
    * Verkle proof verification is also efficient, consisting of N-sized elliptic curve, 4N-size field operations and small constant amount of work. 
    * Additional considerations to SNARK the Verkle proof.

- [x] Quantstamp: the Rise of [Risk-hedging DeFi protocols](https://quantstamp.com/blog/the-rise-of-risk-hedging-defi-protocols) (BarnBridge, Saffron, NAOS, Pendle, 88mph)
    * Hedging against highly-variable interest rates using tranching. Bring fixed interest rates and redistribute risk. 
    * From overall yield - Senior (fixed rate) tranches are paid out first, and junior tranches paid with balance. Large-sized senior tranches result in larger returns for junior traches.
    * Barnbridge: SMART yield - funded by SNX, AAVE, integrated with COMP, AAVE, CREAM.
    * Saffron: tokenize on-chain assets for greater flexibility and access to underlying collateral. Dynamic exposure
    * NAOS: backed by offline income streams. Bank for fixed interst for investors, borrows for real-world collateral. Tokenises debt obligations e.g. corporate loans, receivables. Real world backing is more secure for institutions.
    * Pendle: trading of yield on AMM. Deposit aUSDT, cUSDT to min tokens for underlying asset and future yield. 
    * 88mph: fixed interest lending rate and reward MPH. uses fixed-rate bonds and floarting rate bonds.  Earn stable return even when floating rates are volatile. 
- [x] Tokenizing [Future Yield](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/tokenizing-future-yield)
    * APWine, Pendle, ElementFi - separates ib tokens into principal and yield, allow yield to be sold ahead of time (to lock the future interest instead of the variable distribution over time, or yield speculation)
    * Alchemix - receive yield in advance as debt, and repaid with deposited assets
    * APWine _yield trading_ : 
        * deposit interest-bearing tokens (aDAI, yyUSD) for ib tokens (1:1 of deposit) and future-yield tokens (FYT) (1:1 of deposit, representing the yield of the 1 deposit token over the same duration)
        * APWine: Initial deposits require same about of IBT+FYTs to unlock initial deposits. Assets are locked in cycles, and cycles rollover. 
    * Pendle: issues OT and YT, same concept.  
        * yield is tradeable/LPed for swap fees and $PENDLE on Pendle AMM. 
        * Pendle AMM is constant product x*y=z where z is adjusted to rebalance YT-stablecoin ILs
        * Pendle markets are in frozen or active states
        * Pendle YT can be claimed anytime, is not locked - resulting in YTs natural time decay, and YT holders are naturally selling ASAP. 
    * ElementFi - also PT, YT
        * deposited assets - PTs. PTs can be purchased at a discount for a fixed yield.
        * **Use case 1**: deposit 10 ETH for fixed interest rate, receive ep:ETH PTs. Provide LP for another 10ETH with ep:ETH - now it looks like a single-stake pool.     
        * **Use case 2**, Decollateralize: leverage and compound yeld tokens, recursively selling PT for underlying asset to multiply/amplify exposure held in interest-bearing deposits. however if interest rates decrease from expected rates, resulting in pricinpal loss. 
        - [x] ElementFi [Decollateralize](https://medium.com/element-finance/de-collateralize-an-alternative-to-collateral-backed-loans-b4a7eb49f00) - ** fixed-term loan that pays the borrow fees upfront **. no liquidation risk, no collaterals. 
            * Input: ETH, Yield exposure: DAI, Output: ETH. 
            * sell input ETH, deposit DAI on Element over 3 mos., get epDAI and eyDAI. 
            * sell epDAI for ETH at discount, discount depends on underlying vault and fixed APY. e.g. you may sell 10 epDAI for 9.9 ETH. 
            * balance: deposited DAI is still exposed for interest. ETH balance has slightly decreased. There's no liquidation risk. Cost is the discount 0.1ETH over 3 months. 
            * cost / breaking point: depends on the borrowing rate, which is the yardstick on what is _paid upfront_. In high borrow rates (e.g. strong bull market), decollateralize is not a good option. 
    * Alchemix: take a loan, interest generated on deposit is used to pay back loan. 
        * Compared to banks, **debt in Alchemix is free**
        * vaults are overcollateralized with different ratios and debt ceilings. 
        * synthetic dollar alUSD ensures 1:1 exchage with DAI regardless of peg. 
        * 10% fees paid to treasure, ACLX single staking up to 140% APR.

    * Vyper is intentionally not Turing-complete to ensure predictable ouputs and add overflow checking. 
    * Overflow in Arithmetic operations indicates the result was too large/small to fit in the original data type
    * Vyper lacks modifiers, inheritance, recursion etc. plus overflow checking and strong typing to write simpler, more secure contracts, reduce surface area of attacks.
