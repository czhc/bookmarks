- [x] [21.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZPoqnRZq4) Post Trade Clearing, Settlement & Processing
    * Phases of Trade Execution: 
      1. Execution: buyer and seller enter into a legally binding agreement to transfer securities in exchange for money
      2. Clearing: performing necessary steps for settling e.g. postigin sufficient margin and recording txn
      3. Settlement: Actual exchange of securities for money - transfer of titles and funds
    * Clearing: process of settling claims of one set of financial institutions against claims of other financial institutions. When a trade occurs, clearing house updates the database/ledger by matchig buying and seller.
      * Validating the identity, ownership of assets
      * Validating net exposure 
    * Settlement: Final recording on ledger. Buyer makes payments and seller transfer securities to buyer. Settlement is completed when clearing house ransfers ownership of securities. 
      * DvP: delivery vs payment 
      * Stocks & bonds settle 3 days from date of execution. Govt securities, options and mutual funds settle 1 day. Certificates of deposits are settled on the same day execution. 
    * Netting - in a multiparty transactions, netting uses a centralized party to only perform net txns (reduces gross txns by 90% and more). 
      * e.g. [ASX Clear ](https://www.asx.com.au/services/clearing/asx-clear.htm): is the Clearing House and approved netting market for ASX (AUstralian stock exchange). US clearing houses: NSCC, OCC, ICE Clear US, CME CLearing House, NGX (Natural Gas Exchange) etc. Clearing houses can be specialized in bonds, derivates (cash, interest rate, energy), options etc.
      * ![netting ASX](/assets/netting.png)
      * How is netting done for commodities or physical goods? Clearing house can also be warehouses that hold the commodities (gold, wheat) in terms of % or in warehouse storage. If it is a physical asset (houses), more complicated.
      * **Netting lowers counterparty risk and txn cost** by reducing # of txns that need to processed.
      * [Prime Brokerage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primebrokerage.asp): set of services offered by invesment banks to hedge funds etc. including _cash management, securities lending etc._ as an outsourced function. E.g. Merill Lynch as bank, Goldman Sachs are prime brokerage. 
        * Is netting still beneficial if settlements are instantaneous/simultaneous? No. changse prime brokerage model. Also you'll need to prefund (cash or security) since there is no netting/settling time (t+1, t+2) when trades are simultaneous. Although you can still keep delayed settlements, deployed on the blockchain.
     * **In Blockchain Architecture: directly from Exchanges <> Registries.** No intermediaries of Central Counter Party (risk mgmt) or Central Securities Depositary (Settlemtn Asset Servicing).
       * CH are final custodians of securities / golden records for securities. central banks has golden record for cash. In AU, after netting in t+2 > cash settlement with AU central bank **1 second before** > securities settlement. Clearing systems have a form of digital AUD. 
       - [x] AU plans to [replace CHESS (settlement system) - called Chess Replacement](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-replacement) by 2023 with a [new settlement system](https://blockchain.news/news/asx-delays-blockchain-based-chess-replacement-to-april-2023) using DLT
           * _option of accessing distributed ledger technology (DLT), which will deliver information more efficiently and stimulate competition by enabling anyone to build new services._
           * CHESS enables _dematerialization_ of cash equitity market (physical shares -> electronic), move to _t+5_ (then to _t+2_) settlement and improved effeiciency for post-trade processing in AU
     - [x] ISDA (international swaps and domains assiociation): [Derivatives Common Domain Model (CDM)](https://www.isda.org/2019/10/14/isda-common-domain-model/)
       * ISDA: international global trade organization transaction 99% of derivatives around the world
       * CDM because derivatives infra is inefficient and costly. IDSA introduces a standard representation of events and products. 
       * ISDA: **machine readable/executable data model** for derivatives products and calculations. 
       * Reducing costs in tradie affirmation and mgmt, collateral mgm, regulatory reporting, reconciliation, exercises and settlement, portflio compression, transfers
       * using smart contracs to automate contractual terms
       * CDMS: drive conssitency and standardization of trade data. Increase efficiency and reduce costs in trade life cycle


#### Clearing and Settlement on the blockchain

- [x] [Defi Infrastructure 101](https://medium.com/racecapital/defi-infrastructure-101-overview-market-landscape-78e096a85834): Overview & Market Landscape 
  * All core accounting functions (ledger entries etc.) are handled by the blockchain layer: ethereum, solana, bsc. dApps do not need to create additional systems to reconcile balances, etc. 
  * There is **no separate process of settling/clearing txns**. - all happens when the txn is broadcasted. **Finality** can be a reasonable number of blocks (21 blocks) after the containing block. 
  * DeFi is open-sourced:
    * Composable: forked, remixed, resused in other apps
    * Transaprent: completely auditable for functions, permissions and stored data
    * Auditable: flow of funds including collaterals, trading volume, defaults are visible
  * TradFi runs on [fractional reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp) system (only partly backed by cash) and prone to market shocks  vs DeFi is transparent and over-collateralized
  * TradFi
    *   Infrastsurcture Fragmentation - apps are not build on **common infrastrucutre**
    *   Siloed Appllications - apps are prioprietary to each back, hard to integrate cross-banking
    *   not friendly for developers
  * ![TradFi vs DeFI](/assets/tradfi-vs-defi.png)
    * no **core banking system** - replaced with blockchain
    * no physical infra - ATM, branches etc. or centralized data stores: CRM, data lake, contract mgmt. 
    * publicly auditable - not limited to _authorized 3rd parties_ only
    * settlement in seconds to minutes instead of 3-5 M-F working days only. 
    * minimized rent seekers in execution
  * Missing pieces of defi infra: 
    * Consumer Apps - consumers typically do not interface directly with protocols. Better UI/UX needed
    * CRM: Defi doesn't have customer profile or maangement tools yet
    * Notifications
    * Product Analytics (?) - currently measures blockchain activity, but not engagement
    * Security standards 
    * Txn rollbacks
    * Customdy
    * Developer Platforms: having more middlewares/platforms instead of building directly on protocol
    * Embeddable wallets: wallets are currently external services. 
    * Decentralized Identity
  * Additional improvements on C&S with blockchains
    * distributed ledger is constantly updated for ownership records and shared to simplify process of post-trade transfer cycles, removes needs for backup systems
    * introduce **new settlement mechanisms** including settling land titles, certifications, intellectual property that can be tokenized
    * Financial instrucments - securities, stocks, money, debentures, bonds, land titles, IP can be integrated to form a shared, single settlemtn station and inter-tradeable
- [x] [Introducing Clearing Houses to the Blockchain](https://medium.com/reverseacid/introducing-clearing-houses-to-the-blockchain-20326a463a81)
  * Settlement systems (RTGS, LVPS, IMPS) allow for flow of value across geographical boundaries - compared to physical transfer of value (goods in a warehouse)
  * DvP mechanism solves problem of txn where buyer does not deliver funds or seller does not deliver security. - settlements are intrinsically linked and guaranteed by 3rd parties via Clearance and Settlement, esnure security against abuse of system. CHs are _trusted_ 3rd parties. 
  * Addressable issues: 
    * Flexile Settlement Time: all settlements are rigid: t+1, t+3 etc. Blockchain C&S removes gross settlement (between arbitrators) vs net settlement (transfer of funds at a later point), and efficient even for small volume trades
    * Remove resources for handling gross/net settlemtn
    * Scale: Securities settlements requires high-volume, frequent txns and needs to be efficient, secure and reliable. Settlement houses (e.g. SWIFT) that can scale globally cannot handle small volumes, and vice versa. 
    * Reduce backend costs for post-trade settlements

- [x] DTCC (Clearing House): [Will Blockchain Revolutionize Clearance and Settlement](https://www.dtcc.com/dtcc-connection/galleries/2021/march/10/will-blockchain-revolutionize-clearance-and-settlement)
    * NYSE Clearing House - netting members and securities, DTC - central securities depository for storage of all stock certificates traded in US market. 
    * MYSE SCC + Amex. + NASDAQ -> NSCC National Securities Clearing Corp: multilateral netting across entire US equity market. 
    * DTC + NSCC -> DTCC: enabling clearing and settlment in a single, vertically integated entity
    - [ ] [Steampunk Settlment](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Microsites/Steampunk-Settlement-2018.pdf) - Greenwich on DLT 
    * _(DLT) requiring that all transactions in the U.S. market be funded on a transaction-by-transaction basis, losing the liquidity and risk-mitigating benefits_
    * _instantaneous settlement makes it impossible to fund trading on a secured basis, because it doesn’t allow traders to pledge shares they have yet to transact as collateral. all trades using DLT must be prefunded, and on an unsecured basis - limits market liquidity_ - but why make it possible to just _pledge_ without owning the security?

- [x] [The Defi Hype](https://www.fintechna.com/articles/the-defi-hype-why-it-matters/): why it matters
   * The DeFi stack layers
      *  1. Settlement: the blockchain and its native protocol asset - stores ownership information, secure and guarantees state changes. Trustless execution env, settlement and dispute resolution layer
      *  2. Asset: all aassets issued on top of sttlement layer including native protocol asset and additional assets/tokens
      *  3. Protocol: standards for specific use cases: Dex< debt markets, derivatives, onchain asset maangement implemented by set of smart contracts
      *  4. Application: user-oriented applications that connect to protocols - web frontend etc. Collect usage fees
      *  5. Aggregation: extension of app layer - aggregates applications and protocols, proive tools to compare and rate services etc. 

- [x] [Scaled and Stable Operations: clearing and settlement](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2021/03/scaled-and-stable-operations-clearing-and-settlement.html)
   * Settlement types: crypto2crypto vs crypto2fiat 
   * Crypto 2 Crypto:
      * eliminate counterparty risks, market rissks, credit risk.
      * New risks: fialure of an exchange to secure traded assets, inability to prefund trades or inability to move assets fast enough from offline qallet to liquid only wallet for settlement
   * Crypto 2 Fiat:
      * virtual asset exchanges (crypto exchanges) service as bridge/on-ramp - also referered to as clearing funs.  
   * [VASP](https://ciphertrace.com/what-exactly-is-a-virtual-asset-service-provider-vasp/) - Virtual Asset SErvice privder
      * Crypto exchange can be referred to as VASP, Virtual Asset Enity, Digital Asset Cutomer (DACs), Money Service Business (MSB) etc. 
      * Is a DEX a VASP? _According to FATF guidance, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are VASPs and should be regulated as such._
   * Stablecoins - minters hold and equivalent collateral with Deposit Taking Institutions (DTI).

- [x] [22.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsSzQfejwMk) Trade Finance and Supply Chain
   * **Trade Finance**: financial instruments used to facilitate international trade and commerce (imports, exports) reducing payment and supply risks in global trades. 
      * Multiple parties involved in trade finance: banks, trade finance compnaies, importers and exporters, insurers, export credit agencies.
         *  Exporters (Sellers) - Advising Banks vs Issuing Banks - Importers (Buyers)
      * Trade finance unique inherent risks: currency fluctionaions, political instability, non-payments and credit worthiness of transacting parties
      * Trade finance operational costs are prohibitive for SMEs to meaningfully profit.
      * Financial instruments in trade finance: 
         * lending lings of credit issued by banks to importers/exporters, 
         * **Letter of Credit** with buyer's bank guaranteeing paymets and protecting buyers by escrowing payment. Guarantees bank makes payment to sellers after receiving proof of delivery of goods from seller ('s advising bank). 
         * Factoring and forfaiting - facotring sells firms' account receivebales to a lener, forgeting reliquish exporter rights for immediate cash to exporters i.e. long-term vs short term cash advances. Also differs by who pays overhead costs, recourse, % of financing, timing - [factoring v forfaiting](https://www.smbcompass.com/factoring-vs-forfaiting/)
         * Export credit/working capital for exporters
         * Shipping and Delivery insurance for sellers and non-payment insurance for buyers
      * Trade Finance also improves cash flow by providing extension of credit. 
   * Supply Chain Finance SCP (payables, reverse factoring, supplier finance) is a broader category of trade finance. Introduced in late 80s.
      * Form of invoice factoring. 
      * supply chain finance is a straightforward collaboration between only 3 parties: supplier, buyer and factor/funders - without banks. Easier to get a business loan.
      * SCF providers: Raistone Cpaital, PrimerRevenue etc. 
      * Although banks provide SCF programs e.g. BoA Merrill Lynch i.e. SCF as a Service
      * SCF also allows buyers to select critical suppliers and make early payments. 
   * Financing International Trade using "Trade Credit" via Open Accounts (ship first, pay later) vs cash in advance vs consignment (ship, no payment, exporter takes risks of no-sales).
   * Trade Finance valuation $20T (statista.com)
   * Uses cases for blockchain in trade finance:
      * Multiple parties involved in single txn requires a lot of validation and verifications, now costing significant overhead
      * Transactions require a lot of exchange of documents in digital and physical formats
      * Property rights and large insurable value 
      * _E.g. Bill of lading for oil can trade hands hundreds of times while the oil is still out at sea over a 20 day period_. 
   * **Cost of trust between _multiple parties_** is the specific challenge that cannot be solved by simply _digitizing_ trade finance. Cost of trust in the network is _2^n_ for each trade.
      - [x] [Fraud in Trade finance](https://www.gtreview.com/magazine/volume-19-issue-1/legal-roundtable-learning-lessons-trade-finance-fraud/): cases ultimately involve double-funding invoices: two or more banks are duped into financing one invoice. 
         * SG-based traders left combined total exposure of US5B.
         * _gradual increase of regulatory pressure on the financial services sector has potentially “widened the trade finance gap by pushing banks towards this so-called flight to quality”, to the detriment of SMEs_.

   * Encryption schemes: symm vs asymm keys. Assym encryption introduces the problem of _discovering a trusted and authentic public key_ - in the case of digital certificates, the trusted server (certificate authority) which stores the public key is a single point of trust.
   * Using a blockchain-based we of trust model, all _public keys are stored on public ledger_ - not relying  on a single third-party cert authority.
