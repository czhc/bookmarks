A collection of reading materials I revised for my sabbatical (2021). I aim to be able to recollect and discuss each subject matter at each checkpoint. 

## Zero-knowledge Proofs

ZKP is about statistical likelihood of something being true, or minimizing the probability of a lie. Never 100% true. 

* Completeness: everything that is true has a proof
* Soundness: everything that is provable is true
* Zero-knowledge: only the statement to prove is revealed

### Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof zk-SNARK 

* succinct: 
* non-interactive: 
* argument of knowledge: 

No interaction between prove and verfier
